<h4>Amstrad/Schneider CPC 464</h4>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
With a disk image loaded, the emulation starts from the BASIC "Ready" prompt. <br>
From here you can enter commands to access the disk image: <br>
 <br>
A directory listing can be obtained with: "CAT"<br>
A program can be run with: RUN"filename"<br>
The common programs to run are those with a .BIN or .BAS extension and usually the smaller <br>
of the files on the disk image.<br>
On a few games you can type: RUN"disc or RUN"disk to start the game.<br>
If a directory listing cannot be obtained, then the disc might be copy-protected. <br>
In this case, try: <br>
|CPM<br>
| is obtained by pressing shift and the @ key together. Since the keyboard is mapped so the <br>
keys are in the roughly same place as on a real Amstrad keyboard, then @ can be found <br>
around the [,@,],# keys.<br>
The |CPM works by loading and executing the first sector on the first track of the disc.<br>
Snapshots, which contain a memory dump, CPU state and hardware state, can be run from a <br>
command line interface with the following command: <br>
mess cpc464 -snap "snapshot name"<br>
The snapshot will start automatically.<br>
There are a few excellent utilities for creating and maintaining<br>
disk images for the Amstrad CPC emulators. Here are just a couple - <br>

<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by <br>
default.  Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be <br>
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the <br>
scroll_lock key.   <br>
Runs many disk images and snapshots well.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The CPC464 was an 8-bit Amstrad computer, produced in 1984, with 64k of ram and a tape <br>
recorder built in.<br>
