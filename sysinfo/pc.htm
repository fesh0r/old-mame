<h4>IBM Personal Computer XT (and clones)</h4>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
In early 1980, IBM decided to create a micro computer (up to this date, IBM produced only <br>
mini and mainframe computers), they didn't really know what they wanted and they didn't <br>
think for one second that producing micro computer was a profitable business! They asked <br>
Digital Research (the authors of CP/M) to create an operating system for their new computer.<br>
DR was not very interested, so they approached the then small company Microsoft (at this point <br>
famous for it's BASIC language) to write this operating system. Microsoft wasn't capable of <br>
doing it themselves, so Bill Gates bought up the rights to an OS written by a small company <br>
called Seattle's Computers Products: QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System) which became <br>
PCDOS and later MS-DOS.<br>
The IBM PC wasn't very powerful (and was certainly less powerful than a lot of 8 bit <br>
computers), the very first PC had only 16 KB RAM and no floppy disk units -- they used <br>
cassettes. Notice that the functions to handle the cassettes were present in the operating <br>
system up to MS-DOS 5. The PC was available with either CGA or MDA (on an MPA card). The CGA <br>
adapter actually had an RCA composite output to hook it up to your TV if you did not want the <br>
CGA monitor.<br>
The IBM PC XT was the successor of the IBM PC. It's enhanced features included hard disk <br>
capability, more memory, and no more tape port. Perhaps because of the name and fame of IBM, <br>
the PC series became a standard and IBM dominated the computer market up until the end of the <br>
80's. Clones of the XT, such as the Tandy 1000 became commonplace by the end of the decade.<br>
