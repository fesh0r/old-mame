<h4>Apple Macintosh Plus</h4>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
Introduced on 16th January 1986, the Macintosh Plus was the first real improvement of<br>
the original Macintosh 128k (The Macintosh 512k was just a Mac 128k with 512 kb of RAM). It had<br>
several new features.<br>
The extended ROM held the new version of operating system: it supported hard disk units,<br>
the SCSI bus, and the new file system: HFS (Hierarchical File System), along with many other<br>
new features (Time Manager...). Additionally, various routines and managers previously located<br>
in RAM (Appletalk manager, RAM Serial Driver, Standard File Package...) had been moved to ROM.<br>
The new floppy disk unit could use double-sided 800 kb disks (compared to single-sided 400 kb<br>
for the Macintosh 128k). It came with 1 Mb of RAM, and could easily be expanded to 4 Mb, using<br>
standard 1Mb SIMMs. It had an enhanced keyboard with a numeric pad and last but not least, it had<br>
a SCSI 1 interface which allowed to connect several high speed peripherals (maximal transfer rate of<br>
312 kbyte/s on Mac Plus - which is incredibly inefficient) such as hard disks and scanners.<br>
Although the Mac Plus was made obsolete in march 1987 by the new Macintosh series (Macintosh SE<br>
and the Macintosh II), it remained in production as a cheaper alternative until the introduction<br>
of Macintosh Classic on 15th october 1990. This makes Macintosh Plus the longest lived Macintosh<br>
ever produced.<br>
