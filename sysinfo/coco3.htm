<h4>Tandy Color Computer 3</h4>
First off, also read the history for the Color Computer and Color Computer 2 drivers. Much<br>
of the information there also applies to this driver.<br>
Besides fully emulating the Color Computer 3 this driver also contains some extras. It contains<br>
two different real time clocks. Currently they can be set under the "DIP switches". The two<br>
types are Disto and Cloud-9.<br>
<p><b>Disto Real Time Clock:</b><br>
	Chip:      OKI m6242B<br>
	Addressed: $FF50 and $FF51<br>
<p><b>Cloud-9 Real Time Clock:</b><br>
    Chip:      Dallas Semiconductor's Phantom Time Chip DS1315<br>
    Addressed: $FF79, $FF78, $FF7C<br>
This driver also contains an implementation of Jeff Vavasours' Virtual Hard Disk. See his<br>
Color Computer 3 emulator for information regarding it.<br>
