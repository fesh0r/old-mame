<h4>Myarc Geneve 9640</h4>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
Wait states are not emulated (except for the speech synthesizer), so the Geneve<br>
will always run at full speed.<br>
The keyboard does not seem to work properly in BHDMV.<br>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
This driver emulates a Geneve with (almost) 2Mbytes of RAM, 4 floppy drives,<br>
and a mouse.  3 Hard Disk are supported by the HFDC disk controller.<br>
You need an MDOS disk image to boot the Geneve.  Insert the image and run the<br>
computer.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
Myarc is known as the builder of several fine extension cards for the TI99.<br>
They managed to remain in business for several years after TI abandonned its<br>
TI99 series of computers in 1983, and, in 1987, they even introduced their<br>
Geneve 9640 computer.  The computer is a single card to be inserted in the TI<br>
PEB as a replacement of the TI99 console.  The card has standard connectors to<br>
attach a PC-XT keyboard and a monitor, but no other I/O ports, as the Geneve<br>
relies on expansion cards in the PEB to provide disk and RS232 interfaces.  The<br>
Geneve features a TMS9995 at 12MHz, a V9938 VDP, an SN76496 sound generator<br>
(compatible with TMS9919), a MM58274 RTC, 512 kbytes of 1-wait-state CPU RAM<br>
(expandable to almost 2 Mbytes), 32 kbytes of 0-wait-state CPU RAM (expandable<br>
to 64 kbytes), and 128 kbytes of VRAM (expandable to 192 kbytes).  Thanks to<br>
the GenMod modification, the 512 kbytes of on-board RAM can be disabled so that<br>
0-wait-state RAM may be used instead, but this breaks the TI99 emulation mode.<br>
Although the Geneve is compatible with the TI99, it is a different machine.  It<br>
has a disk-based Operating System that looks like MS-DOS.  It has two operating<br>
modes: a native mode, and a TI99-compatible mode.  The TI99 mode is normally<br>
entered by running the GPL program: the Geneve can run most TI99 programs in<br>
this mode, which uses some special areas of CPU RAM to emulate GROMs and<br>
cartridge ROMs.<br>
