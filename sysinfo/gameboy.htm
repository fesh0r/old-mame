<h4>Nintendo Game Boy (1989)</h4>
The Game Boy was a huge success for Nintendo. It was the second portable system <br>
created by Nintendo (the first being the Game & Watch series starting in 1980). The <br>
original Game Boy was released in 1989 and allowed game players to play a huge library <br>
of games away from home.  Games like Super Mario Land, The Legend of Zelda: Link's <br>
Awakening and Tetris proved that quality games could be developed for portable use.<br>
Nintendo later released the “Play it Loud” Game Boy series in 5 colors, and the redesigned <br>
slimmed down Game Boy pocket version was released in 1996.<br>
