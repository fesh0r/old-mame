<h4>Pravetz 8D</h4>
The emulation is the same as the Oric Atmos. (I don't know if there are any hardware<br>
differences compared to an original Oric Atmos, if there are please tell me and I will<br>
implement them).<br>
<p><b>Disk:</b><br>
The disk drive interface has a boot-rom which loads the DOS from the disc<br>
in the drive. <br>
<p><b>The driver supports 2 versions of the disc interface:</b><br>
- "low dos 8d" has a 256 byte boot rom and supports DOS v1.0 to v1.30 ("Apple 2" on dipswitch)<br>
- "high dos 8d" has a 512 byte boot rom and supports DOS v2.10 and higher. ("Apple 2 v2" on dipswitch)<br>
<p><b>If you are using the standard prav8d driver you will need to type:</b><br>
CALL #320<br>
to start the boot procedure.<br>
If you are using prav8dd (with the "BOBY" rom), then the disc is booted<br>
automatically.<br>
The Pravetz 8D uses Apple 2 compatible disk drives only and these<br>
are supported by the driver. <br>
<p><b>Here is a brief listing of DOS commands provided by George:</b><br>
<p><b>options:</b><br>
f - FileName (1-30 signs)<br>
d - drive (one or two)<br>
v - volume<br>
a - beginning address<br>
e - end address<br>
l - record length<br>
r - record number<br>
b - number of byte in the record<br>
<p><b>filetypes:</b><br>
B - Basic program<br>
C - Bynary file<br>
T - Text file<br>
M - Text file, created with Make command ( batch file:) )<br>
<p><b>commands:</b><br>
DIR [1] [2] - not comment<br>
INIT [,Vv] [,Dd] - formatting Disk (in first or second Disk Drive)<br>
DOS [f] [,Dd], [,Vv] - writing Dos on the disk without formatting It. File f automatically starts after booting<br>
MAP [1] [2] - show chart of the disk.<br>
SAVE f [,A,a] [,Ee] [,Vv] [,Dd] - Saves file on the disk. If missing parameter of the addresses A,E - <br>
saving Basic file in Memory<br>
LOAD f [,Aa] [,Dd] [,Vv] - loads file in memory<br>
MERGE - adding program in Basic to already exists in Memory<br>
- -only for files B or C types. Loads file in Memory and start It. (RUN and BRUN together in Apple ][)<br>
DELETE f [,Dd] [,Vv] - deleting file f<br>
RENAME f1, f2 [,Vv] [,Dd] - renaming last name of the file f1 with f2<br>
* f [,Dd] [,Vv] - lock/unlock file<br>
MAXFILES m - allowing up to m open files<br>
VERIFY f [,Dd] [,Vv] - checks surface integrity of file<br>
EXIT - leaving Dos<br>
OPEN f [,Vv] [,Dd] - open file for read/write<br>
CLOSE [f] - closing f. If there's no f pointed - closes all open files<br>
READ f [,Bb] - points that will be reading of the file with command INPUT<br>
WRITE f [,Bb] - writes in Text file<br>
APPEND f [,Vv] [,Dd] - adding information in Text file. Always there's WRITE after It<br>
POSITION f [,Rr] - allow writing or reading in Text file from r position<br>
<p><b>in Program mode using of the commands is:</b><br>
10LPRINT CHR$(2); "MAXFILES 5"<br>
e.g.<br>
<p><b>To load a program called "MONITOR" type:</b><br>
LOAD MONITOR<br>
often you will see a load address (it is the first number with # prefix).<br>
Now type CALL #&lt;number&gt; to execute the program.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Pravetz 8D is a Bulgarian clone of the Oric Atmos.<br>
It was produced between 1985 and 1989: Pravetz is both the name of the firm and the name of<br>
the city where the firm is located. The "D" in the name stands for "Domashen" ('home' in<br>
Bulgarian) while the "8" stands for (you've never guess!) '8 bits'.<br>
<p><b>There was a whole family of Pravetz computer which included the following models:</b><br>
Pravetz 82, 8M, 8A, 8E, 8C, 8D (8 bits)<br>
Pravetz 16, 16A, 286 (16 bits, PC clones)<br>
Most of 8 bits machines were Apple II compatibles, "8D" being the exception. The "8D" model was<br>
issued in 1985 and cost 420 lev - if you think that the average salary by that time was about<br>
180-200 lev, you can see that it was pretty expensive.<br>
The "82" model was the trade name of a machine called "IMKO-2" and was released in 1981. The "IMKO-2"<br>
was the upgraded version of the "IMKO", designed in 1979 and used for robot control.<br>
The main differences from the Oric Atmos were obviously the keyboard and the floppy interface.<br>
The Pravetz 8D can display both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets - the one currently in use is selected<br>
by the key labelled "C/L" which takes place of the "FUNCT" key present on the Atmos. Other features<br>
of the keyboard are the "ESC" and "CTRL" keys, labeled respectively "OSV" and "MK".<br>
During Pravetz' glory days none of Oric's disk interfaces were imported in Bulgaria, thus the magazine<br>
"Computer for you" organized a competition to develop a disk interface which was compatible with<br>
the most widespread disk drive currently used, namely the Apple II's disk drive.<br>
The competition was won in 1989 by Borislav "Boby" Zahariev, student at MEI University of Sofia.<br>
The first version of the disk interface used top 16Kb of RAM to store the DOS, which prevented<br>
users from loading larger programs. Later Boris developed an upgrade of his interface which<br>
used in conjunction with a new version of the DOS allowed programs to use the whole memory. He provided<br>
also a new version of BIOS which detected the presence of the interface and automatically booted<br>
the DOS from the disk.<br>
