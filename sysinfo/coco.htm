<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
<ul>
<li> Cassette images (.cas):
</ul>
Not all of these work; don't panic.<br>
You can pick the cassette image you wish to run from the FILE MANAGER in the Tab/Options menu.<br>
Once you've selected the image, go back into the CoCo emulation, and use "scroll lock" to set <br>
it back in keyboard emulation mode.<br>
type CLOAD (if it's a BASIC program) or CLOADM (for assembler programs)<br>
then EXEC (if it's an assembler program)<br>
or RUN (if it's a basic program)<br>
If you include the name of the file (eg. CLOAD "PROG") it will skip any files preceding the<br>
one you specified.<br>
<ul>
<li> Snapshot images (.PAK)
</ul>
Go to file menu pick the .pak<br>
Should automatically start running the game.<br>
if it does not run, it isn't supported yet.<br>
<ul>
<li> Cartridge rom images (.ROM)
</ul>
Go to file menu and pick the .rom<br>
Reset to CoCo and it will start running the game.<br>
if it does not run it isn't supported yet.<br>
<ul>
<li>Diskette images (.DSK)
</ul>
Basically the same as cassette images, except you insert the image in Floppy Disk#1 <br>
from the file manager. Once you return to the coco emulation, switch back to keyboard <br>
<p><b>emulation mode by pressing SCROLL LOCK and type:</b><br>
DIR<br>
To load a binary file (/BIN), type LOADM "GAME/BIN:1" (replacing the ":1" with the <br>
appropriate drive designation ":0" through ":3" )<br>
then EXEC<br>
To load a basic file (/BAS), type LOAD "GAME/BAS:0"<br>
then RUN<br>
Thanks to "Axe" for the command summary.<br>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by <br>
default. Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be <br>
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the <br>
scroll_lock key.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Tandy TRS-80 Color Computer was typically called 'CoCo'. It was compatible with the <br>
Welsh Dragon 32: they can use same software and cartridges. Unlike the Dragon, though, it <br>
used its own basic, Tandy Basic instead of the Microsoft basic. It was followed by the <br>
TRS 80 color computer II. The two BASICs use different tokens so they are not binary<br>
compatible.<br>
The Tandy/TRS-80 Color Computer 2 (CoCo 2) replaced the original in 1983. It has the same <br>
characteristics than the first. It has 16 KB RAM and can have a 16 KB ROM which contains <br>
Microsoft Basic. It was replaced with the Tandy Color Computer 3 in 1986. <br>
The Tandy Color Computer 3 is the successor of the Tandy/TRS-80 Color Computer 2. It can <br>
work with OS-9 Level II (an operating system designed for 6809 processors). As this processor<br>
is an 8 bit (strange choice when Atari and Commodore were using a 68000), it can't access <br>
simultaneously to the 128 KB (or 512 KB), it uses several RAM banks (as the Thomson TO8, or <br>
MSX 2 computers) which can be switched in 8K blocks. <br>
Tandy made several prototypes of a Tandy Color Computer 4 but it was never released. The <br>
DRAGON 32 enjoyed a pretty good success in Europe. Its ROM holds the Operating System and a <br>
BASIC programming language by Microsoft. One of its characteristics is partial compatibility <br>
with the Tandy TRS-80 Color Computer Series: they can use same peripherals and some <br>
cartridges. Two years later, Welsh launched the DRAGON 64 which has the same <br>
characteristics except the added memory (64 KB instead of 32 KB), a RS232c port and a keyboard <br>
with repetitive keys.<br>
