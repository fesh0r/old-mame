<h4>Amstrad PCW16</h4>
This is a successor to the PCW 8xxx and PCW9xxx series.<br>
It is a re-designed machine, with a 16Mhz Z80 CPU, improved graphics and improved hardware, <br>
and a nice GUI system.<br>
This system takes advantage of a Super I/O chip, as used in many PCs, which provides PC <br>
Floppy Disc Controller, Serial and Parallel port hardware. As a result, the system uses <br>
a PC-AT keyboard and PC Serial Mouse.<br>
The PCW16 has a high-density floppy disc drive which uses the MSDOS filesystem.<br>
The OS comes on a rescue disc and is installed into 2MB flash-file memory. This is also used <br>
for storing documents, files and user details. The main purpose of this machine, like the original is <br>
wordprocessing, spreadsheet and other business tasks.<br>
Other programs have been written for it, including a CP/M "shell" by John Elliot <br>
(www.seasip.demon.co.uk), a route-planner and more. You can run these by selecting <br>
"Run External Program" from the "Tasks" menu.<br>
This system contains the "Anne" ASIC custom chip designed by Amstrad. Technical <br>
information is still available and the rescue disc can be downloaded from Cliff Lawsons <br>
Amstrad computer support site at: <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/cliff.lawson/">http://web.ukonline.co.uk/cliff.lawson/</a> (the disc is <br>
listed in the files section). Cliff works at Amstrad plc, and has worked on the many <br>
projects from the Amstrad CPC to the latest e-mail phone.<br>
Mess Emulation State<br>
--------------------<br>
All major functions are working and the computer is useable, however there<br>
are some accuracy problems.<br>
a. SCREEN DISPLAY<br>
-----------------<br>
The screen emulation does not support mid-frame or mid-line changes.<br>
I don't think any programs do this yet?<br>
b. PRINTER<br>
----------<br>
Not working. The printer emulation assumes a ECP/EPP compatible parallel port<br>
which is not yet emulated. Therefore you cannot print out documents :(<br>
c. HARD DRIVE<br>
-------------<br>
Not emulated. Has anyone used a hard-drive on their PCW16? Please let me know<br>
and I will add support for it.<br>
d. ANALOGUE JOYSTICKS<br>
---------------------<br>
Not emulated. Are there any programs which use the joysticks?<br>
Notes<br>
-----<br>
To use the PCW16 you will need the OS rescue disc, when this has been inserted,<br>
and the on/off switch has been toggled (see UI for the dipswitch to do this),<br>
then the OS will be installed.<br>
When the OS is installed the computer is now useable and you can write documents<br>
and perform tasks.<br>
The emulation will run the CP/M implementation by John Elliot. It should run<br>
almost all software provided it is in a disc image.<br>
Development has been halted because this computer is in a working state.<br>
I plan to go back to it to fix the remaining problems at a later date when I<br>
have more time and more information.<br>
If you want to see more added to this driver, please contact me and I will<br>
try and fix it.<br>
