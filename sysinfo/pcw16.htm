Amstrad PCW16<br>
-------------<br>
The Amstrad PCW16 was designed for the same reason as the Amstrad PCW.<br>
This system has been greatly enhanced with a faster CPU, enhanced graphics<br>
resolution and colours, and a really nice user interface.<br>
The PCW16 has a high-density floppy disc drive which uses the MSDOS filesystem.<br>
The computer has 2mb of flash file memory which is used to store documents<br>
and user details.<br>
The PCW16 uses a Super I/O chip which is found in many modern PC's and this<br>
provides serial, parallel, floppy disc drive, hard drive and joystick functions.<br>
Mess Emulation State<br>
--------------------<br>
All major functions are working and the computer is useable, however there<br>
are some accuracy problems.<br>
a. SCREEN DISPLAY<br>
-----------------<br>
The screen emulation does not support mid-frame or mid-line changes.<br>
I don't think any programs do this yet?<br>
b. PRINTER<br>
----------<br>
Not working. The printer emulation assumes a ECP/EPP compatible parallel port<br>
which is not yet emulated. Therefore you cannot print out documents :(<br>
c. HARD DRIVE<br>
-------------<br>
Not emulated. Has anyone used a hard-drive on their PCW16? Please let me know<br>
and I will add support for it.<br>
d. ANALOGUE JOYSTICKS<br>
---------------------<br>
Not emulated. Are there any programs which use the joysticks?<br>
Notes<br>
-----<br>
To use the PCW16 you will need the OS rescue disc, when this has been inserted,<br>
and the on/off switch has been toggled (see UI for the dipswitch to do this),<br>
then the OS will be installed.<br>
When the OS is installed the computer is now useable and you can write documents<br>
and perform tasks.<br>
The emulation will run the CP/M implementation by John Elliot. It should run<br>
almost all software provided it is in a disc image.<br>
Development has been halted because this computer is in a working state.<br>
I plan to go back to it to fix the remaining problems at a later date when I<br>
have more time and more information.<br>
If you want to see more added to this driver, please contact me and I will<br>
try and fix it.<br>
