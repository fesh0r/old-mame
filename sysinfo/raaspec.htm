<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Spectrum I+ was a modified Vectrex. It had a 32K ROM cart and 2K additional battery <br>
backed RAM (0x8000 - 0x87ff). PB6 was used to signal inserted coins to the VIA. The <br>
unit was controlled by 8 buttons (2x4 buttons of controller 1 and 2).  Each button had a <br>
LED which were mapped to 0xa000.  The service mode can be accessed by pressing button 8 <br>
during startup.  As soon as all LEDs light up, press 2 and 3 without releasing 8. Then <br>
release 8 and after that 2 and 3. You can leave the screen where you enter ads by <br>
pressing 8 several times.<br>
