<h4>Tandy/Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I</h4>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
keyboard - relatively close to the original layout.<br>
Take a look into the "Options" menu, accessible by hitting TAB, and choose "Keys (This <br>
Machine)" to  find out more about the key mapping.<br>
cassette - emulation of virtual tapes supported.<br>
Use SYSTEM or CLOAD commands to read images.<br>
SYSTEM supports 6 character filenames and loads the corresponding FILENM.CAS image.<br>
CLOAD loads a file named BASIC(N).CAS, where (N) is the character you supplied <br>
(e.g. CLOAD"M" loads BASICM.CAS)<br>
floppies - emulation of virtual floppy discs supported. <br>
Use a NEWDOS/80 boot disk for drive 0 and set up correct PDRIVE parameters for the other drives. If only drives 0 to 2 are used they can be double sided by interpreting drive select 3 as head select bit.<br>
Under the "Options" menu, accessible by hitting TAB, there are three settings.<br>
"Floppy Disc Drives"  - enable or disable floppy disc controller.<br>
"Video RAM"           - enable upper case only or upper/lower font.<br>
"Virtual E000-EFFF"   - enable 4K Extension ROM or make it RAM.<br>
The TRS-80 driver should run most of the known programs out there. It supports a WD 179x <br>
floppy disc controller with up to four virtual floppy disc drives contained in image files.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Tandy TRS-80 model 1, released in August 1977 at a US retail price of $399 for just the <br>
keyboard/computer or $599 including display and cassette storage unit, was the first member <br>
of one of the most famous computer families.The earliest models used a poor BASIC interpreter <br>
called Basic Level 1 (the interpreter and the OS fit in the 4 KB ROM) which had no instruction <br>
to save the program! It was replaced later with the Basic Level 2 which needed a 12 KB ROM. <br>
To offset its poor characteristics, Tandy developed a device called the Expansion Interface <br>
which brought a lot of new features: 16, 32 or 48 KB RAM, two tape unit connectors, a printer <br>
port, a floppy disk controller, a serial port and a real time clock.<br>
When it was connected to a floppy disk unit, the TRS 80 used the TRS DOS operating system, it <br>
was pretty bugged and most of the TRS80 users preferred NEW DOS, it is an operating system <br>
done by a third-party company called Apparat. This OS was the real TRS 80 operating system.<br>
The Model 1 was followed with the TRS 80 model II and model III (the model III had almost the <br>
same characteristics as the model I).<br>
