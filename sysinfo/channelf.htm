<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
Introduced in August 1976 at a suggested retail price of $170 (US), The Channel F was the <br>
first programmable video game system to use replaceable cartridges. The controllers, which were<br>
often described as looking like plungers were attached directly to the system via 8 foot wires.<br>
The Channel F didn't fair well in the late 1970s market dominated by Atari, and Fairchild switched <br>
their efforts to developing the Spark-16 minicomputer.<br>
