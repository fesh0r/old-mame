<h4>Commodore 64</h4>
<p><b>Diskette Usage:</b><br>
Disk drives are simulated at the moment, and only file loads from drive 8 and 9 <br>
are implemented. You can load a program file from the rom directory (*.prg,*.p00)<br>
You can also load a file from a d64 image (The directory command LOAD"$",8 is supported when <br>
using d64 images).<br>
 <br>
Within the emulation, basic programs can be loaded with:  LOAD"filename",8 <br>
 <br>
Machine language programs can be loaded to their address with:  LOAD"filename",8,1<br>
 <br>
When a program is loaded, type RUN or the appropriate SYS call to start it. <br>
 <br>
Note that several programs rely on more features not currently emulated (such as <br>
loading other file types, writing...) Some games also rely on starting programs in the <br>
floppy drive's processor (and therefore CPU level emulation of the 1541 is needed).<br>
<p><b>Cartridge Usage:</b><br>
Cartridges may have any of the following extensions: .prg .crt .80 .90 .a0 .b0 <br>
.e0 .f0   Files with boot-sign in it are recognized as roms. Some cartridges may require more <br>
than one image.<br>
 <br>
.prg files loaded at address in its first two bytes<br>
 <br>
.?0 files are loaded to the address specified in the extension.<br>
 <br>
.crt roms are loaded to the addresses specified in crt file.<br>
 <br>
Note that .prg files are assigned to the quickloader (so you have to use <br>
the -cart switch when loading rom images).<br>
<p><b>Cassette Usage:</b><br>
Cassette images with the .wav or .prg extensions as well as multiple .prg files <br>
contained within a zip file can be loaded. Zip files must be placed in the current directory, <br>
and the contained prg files are played in sequential order.<br>
 <br>
The format for WAVs are: <br>
8 bit (16 bit may work, but hasn't been tested), mono, 12500 Hz minimum. This has the same <br>
problems as an original Datasette tape drive (the tone head must be adjusted to get working <br>
(no load error...) wav-files)<br>
 <br>
Note that tape volume is DAC1 volume within the MESS UI On Screen Display Options (accessed<br>
with the tilde (~) key in the DOS version.<br>
 <br>
Within the emulation, use LOAD or LOAD"" or LOAD"",1 for loading normal programs. Use <br>
LOAD"",1,1 for loading programs to a special address.<br>
<p><b>Quickloader Usage:</b><br>
A quickloader is available via the f8 key. It supports program image files with <br>
the .prg and .p00 extensions. This loads the program into memory and sets the program end <br>
pointer. It works with most programs. The program can be started by entering "RUN" in the <br>
emulation.<br>
<p><b>Miscellaneous Usage Notes:</b><br>
Gameport A supports paddles 1 & 2,  joystick 1, lightpen (implementation not finished).<br>
Gameport B supports paddles 3 & 4, joystick 2<br>
If you run into difficulty, be sure to start the emulation with the -log switch, and look into<br>
the error.log file that is created in your mess directory.<br>
If the game runs too fast with the NTSC version, try the PAL version! (c64pal)<br>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
The rasterline based video system currently has the following issues: no CPU holding, imperfect <br>
scrolling support (when 40 columns or 25 lines), lightpen support not finished, rasterline not <br>
finished.<br>
Sound is not currently supported<br>
The restore key is not currently working.<br>
NTSC/PAL select not correct.<br>
The Gameports do not support the mouse (Serial Protocol?).<br>
No printer or other devices support in the serial bus (apart from simple disk drives).<br>
Simple tape support not working (cia timing?)<br>
As far as expansion modules go, non-bankswitching rom cartridges (exrom) should work, but no <br>
other rom cartridges (those with bankswitching logic in it, switching exrom, game). There is <br>
no ieee488 support nor support for other expansion modules.<br>
No userport support and no rs232/v.24 interface.<br>
 <br>
Some issues with the cia6526: <br>
port a,b<br>
handshake support, flag input, not pc output<br>
no serial in/out, cnt<br>
timer a,b<br>
not counting of external clocks<br>
not switching port b pins<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
 <br>
Designed similar to the Vic-20, the Commodore 64 featured a better video chip supporting <br>
sprites, as well as the famous sid6581 sound chip, two "Atari-compatible" joystick ports,<br>
and 64 kilobytes of RAM.<br>
 <br>
The Commodore 64 is, along with the Apple II and the Atari 8-Bit computers, one of the <br>
most famous home computers of it's era. During its production from 1982 to 1993 (!) 17 <br>
to 22 million (!) of these computer would sell, to put in perspective, that's more than <br>
all the Macintoshes in the world. It was one of the first to offer a high quality sound <br>
chip and graphic resolution with many colors and sprites. A great range of peripherals <br>
was developed for this computer and can use several of the Vic 20 peripherals. <br>
 <br>
Several versions of the Commodore 64 were launched : The first one (C64-1) uses the VIC 20 <br>
case, it will be quickly replaced with the C64-2 which uses the famous brown case and by <br>
the C64-3 with small cosmetic changes in the keyboard. A special version called Educator 64 <br>
or PET64 or CBM 4064 was proposed for schools and uses the PET case.<br>
 <br>
Commodore produced the first generation of C64s until May 1986, then it was discontinued <br>
and they introduced the C64C. According to the 64'er magazine, this version has been <br>
planned since the Hannover mass in 1985, but as the old version sold so well during <br>
Christmas '85, its release date was pushed back.<br>
 <br>
The new model does not differ much from its predecessor, the only innovation is the <br>
flatter case, which makes the keyboard (which has off-white keys now) more ergonomic <br>
(it looks like the C128 case), as it is less higher than the old one. But the new case <br>
did not only have advantages: due to its low profile and additional metal screening, <br>
some of the numerous hardware expansions did not fit anymore. This was changed with <br>
the C64G. The 64'er staff noticed that VIC-II as well as the two CIAs have new version <br>
numbers; they didn't write which, though (these are probably just bugfixed chips). <br>
 <br>
The official name for this model was "C=64 C", but nevertheless the German 64'er magazine <br>
decided to call it "C64-II" (because the first units didn't have the new name on the label <br>
at the bottom), the badges on all the 64 C's just says "Commodore 64". They pointed out <br>
that this name was only valid for the 64'er magazine, but since the 64'er was the <br>
magazine for the C64 for a long time, the name was widely accepted and so this model <br>
is mostly known as "C64-II" in Germany.<br>
 <br>
The C64C appeared again after (or concurrently with?) the C64G, this time with the new, <br>
short board. So, although the case might look the same and the label says "Commodore 64", <br>
the boards may be completely different.<br>
 <br>
Commodore also released a "laptop version" (though hardly portable) of the C64, called SX64. <br>
This computer has a built-in 5" color screen, one detachable keyboard, one 5.25" floppy <br>
disk drive (the famous 1541) and a second one can be installed as well. A version called <br>
DX-64 was launched (in very limited quantities) at the same time, it has same <br>
characteristics as the SX64 except its two 5.25" floppy disk drives. The SX64 and DX64 <br>
computers never had success, but it is known as the world's first color portable.<br>
 <br>
The C64GS was released in 1990. Basically it was a re-boxed C64, without a keyboard or any <br>
other interfaces, except for the cartridge slot on top. It didn't have much success as you <br>
could buy a C64 for not much extra, and the C64GS games would still work on the C64.<br>
It came with one game cartridge containing International Soccer, Klax, Flimbo's Quest<br>
and Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O'Fun. The carts had a memory of 4 megabits (512k).<br>
