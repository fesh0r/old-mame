<h4>EACA Colour Genie 2000</h4>
<p><b>Cassette Usage:</b><br>
From within the emulation you can use SYSTEM or CLOAD commands to read images: <br>
SYSTEM supports 6 character filenames.<br>
CLOAD loads a file named BASIC(N).CAS, where (N) is the character you supplied <br>
(e.g., CLOAD"M" loads BASICM.CAS)<br>
CLOAD is for BASIC type tapes only.  It should work if you have a BASIC *.cas file. <br>
File "names" in that case are _one_ character in length (inside the emulation).  In your <br>
roms/cgenie folder the names will be basicA.cas, basicB.cas and so on.  If you CSAVE"A you'll <br>
see a file basicA.cas later and you can CLOAD"A it again. <br>
To load a binary image there was a different command: SYSTEM<br>
You'll see a prompt looking like this: <br>
*?<br>
and there you can enter a name of up to six (wow!) characters.<br>
*?chop16 [ENTER]<br>
This will start loading a file named chop16.cas if it is in your rompath. If you don't have <br>
it... well, wait and see (nothing ;)  If you have it, you'll see two stars (**) in the upper <br>
right corner.  The right one will twinkle after every couple of bytes loaded, every 254 I <br>
think.<br>
	<br>
After several minutes you'll see the prompt again<br>
*?<br>
now type / (slash) and ENTER and the program will be started at it's defined run address. If <br>
a program does not have a run address, you could also specify /[decimal value] to run from a <br>
specific value...<br>
 <br>
<p><b>Diskette Usage:</b><br>
When the emulation starts, tap [ENTER] and also confirm the following <br>
	<br>
MEM SIZE?<br>
with [ENTER].<br>
After that you're in BASIC (DISK BASIC, to be exact, unless you disable cgdos.rom via the <br>
dip switches).<br>
Now you can use the DISK BASIC extensions to issue commands.  Most important<br>
CMD"I[disk#] <br>
Display inventory, disk# is optional and can be from 0 to 3<br>
You can use CMD"I0" to "CMDI3" to get an inventory of drive 0 to 3.<br>
Use CMD"S FILENAME/CMD" to start a binary executable or use LOAD"FILENAME/BAS" to load a basic <br>
program.<br>
CMD"Sname/cmd will start a binary file name/cmd from any disk<br>
CMD"Limage/bin:3 will load image/bin from disk 3<br>
To start a game, eg. paint/cmd, type<br>
cmd"s paint/cmd<br>
You can omit the blank between cmd"s and the filename.<br>
To ease things you could also enable my DOS lookalike frontend ;) It's contained in <br>
newe000.rom (2,772 bytes; CRC 953491a7) but not enabled by default. If you enable it <br>
you can type HELP (hehe ;) and DIR and simply give a name to execute a binary file.<br>
The optional newe000.rom is loaded if the corresponding "dip switch" is set from within the <br>
driver itself. There is no need to specify this rom on the command line.<br>
<p><b>Miscellaneous Usage Notes:</b><br>
 <br>
Under the "Options" menu, accessible by hitting TAB, there are three settings: <br>
"Floppy Disc Drives"  - enable or disable floppy disc controller.<br>
"DOS ROM C000-DFFF"   - enable 8K DOS ROM or make it RAM.<br>
"EXT ROM E000-EFFF"   - enable 4K Extension ROM or make it RAM.<br>
<p><b>Known issues:</b><br>
Startup with CAS or CMD images does not always work. Use the BASIC SYSTEM or CLOAD commands <br>
to read cassette image files, or use the Colour Genie DOS ROM with floppy disc images to run <br>
programs. The driver does not yet emulate the printer port mode for AY-3-8910. Right now it <br>
always uses the AY-3-8910 ports for joystick emulation.<br>
Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by <br>
default.  Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be <br>
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the <br>
scroll_lock key.   <br>
The Colour Genie driver should run most of the known programs out there. It supports the <br>
Motorola 6845 CRT controller with text and graphics modes (LGR and FGR), the AY-3-8910 <br>
sound chip with three audio channels and noise and the WD 179x floppy disc controller with up <br>
to four virtual floppy disc drives contained in image files.<br>
The keyboard is relatively close to the original layout; see "Keys (This Machine)" in the<br>
TAB/Options menu.<br>
Emulation of dual Colour Genie joysticks with keypads is also supported.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Colour Genie is the successor of the Genie 1, Genie 2 and Genie 3. It is not possible <br>
to mix characters and graphics because text and graphic memories are not mixed. There was <br>
a little level display located above the keyboard which allows to set the recording <br>
level of the tape recorder to avoid failure when writing onto a tape. <br>
