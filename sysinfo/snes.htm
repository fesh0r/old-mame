<h4>Super Nintendo Entertainment System (1989)</h4>
The Super Nintendo features true stereo sound, multiple scrolling backgrounds and almost twice the internal memory as its competition. The SNES was home to the biggest, baddest games of its day. With player's choice games like The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Donkey Kong Country and Super Metroid, the Super NES has sold more than 20 million systems in the U.S. and 46 million systems worldwide.
