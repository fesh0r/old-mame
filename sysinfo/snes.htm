<h4>Super Nintendo Entertainment System (1989)</h4>
Nintendo released the cartridge based 16-bit Super Nintendo to compete with the already released <br>
Sega Genesis and NEC's TurboGraphix 16 (PCEngine in Japan). The Super Nintendo features true <br>
stereo sound, multiple scrolling backgrounds and increased internal memory. It was a very popular<br>
system because people could play continuations of their favorite NES game. The Legend of Zelda: <br>
A Link To The Past, The Donkey Kong Country Series, The Final Fantasy Series and Super Mario Kart<br>
were a few of the top titles for the SNES. In 1997 Nintendo redesigned the case, but never <br>
included a CD-ROM expansion.<br>
