<h4>Capcom CPS Changer</h4>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
Perhaps inspired by SNK's Neo-Geo, Capcom released the Capcom Power System Changer (CPS in <br>
this case NOT referring to Capcom Play System) in 1994, as an attempt to sell their arcade <br>
games in console format.  The console basically served as an encased SuperGun (Television <br>
JAMMA adapter) but was wired up so coin inputs could not be added by hackers, and only the<br>
special CPS Changer cartridge boards would work. The CPS Changer had outputs for Composite<br>
video, S-Video and 8 channel mono audio. It's joystick (named the "CPS Fighter") had the<br>
same connection as the Super Famicom, and was even marketed separately for that console.<br>
The games came as PCBs in plastic casing, and were virtually identical to their CPS-1 arcade<br>
counterparts, though they often contained extra debugging features.  The CPS Changer was<br>
sold as a package deal of the console itself, one CPS Fighter controller, and the Street<br>
Fighter II Turbo game for 39,800 yen. Additional games were sold for about 20,000 yen.<br>
The CPS Changer sold poorly though, and support was dropped in March 1996 after releasing <br>
the console's only unique (as in non-CPS1) title: Street Fighter Zero, for 35,000 yen.<br>
Street Fighter Zero was a downscaled version of the CPS2 arcade version from the year prior.<br>
It ran somewhat choppier, had a reduced colour depth, and the sounds were at a lower sample<br>
rate.<br>
Ten other games were released for the CPS Changer, though none have been dumped at present<br>
(to the best of my knowledge). If/when these are dumped, support will be added for them: <br>
Captain Commando (1995)<br>
Final Fight  (1994)<br>
The King of Dragons (1995)<br>
Knights of the Round (1995)<br>
Muscle Bomber:The Body Explosion (1994)<br>
Muscle Bomber Duo: Burn Up Warriors (1995)<br>
Quiz Capcom World 2 (1994)<br>
Street Fighter II' Champion Edition (1994)<br>
Street Fighter II Turbo (1994, Pack-in)<br>
Tenchi O Kurau II (1995)<br>
