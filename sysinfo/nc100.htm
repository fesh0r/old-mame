<h4>Amstrad NC100 Notepad computer</h4>
------------------------------<br>
The Amstrad NC100 Notepad computer is a portable computer.<br>
This system has a LCD screen and nice keyboard. The memory is<br>
protected by a lithium battery which is charged when the computer<br>
is connected to a mains supply.<br>
PCMCIA ram cards can be used to store programs and documents.<br>
The computer has a built in wordprocessor, BBC Basic, Serial Terminal,<br>
Calculator, Diary and more. The whole system is a personal organizer with lots<br>
of extras.<br>
Mess Emulation State<br>
--------------------<br>
a. ACCURACY<br>
-----------<br>
The emulation is reasonably accurate. I have used NCIOSPEC.TXT published by Cliff<br>
Lawson at Amstrad to write the driver. Unfortunately this document does not describe<br>
undocumented hardware features, so at this time, any programs relying on undocumented<br>
behaviour will not work well. I am currently looking for NC owners (especially NC150<br>
owners) to run some tests for me.<br>
a. PRINTER<br>
----------<br>
Printer emulation is working. All data is saved out to a file on the host filesystem.<br>
The data is not processed in any way, so the file will contain the raw bytes output<br>
to the printer port.<br>
b. PCMCIA RAM CARD<br>
------------------<br>
The NC100 supports a PCMCIA Ram card up to 1mb in size. <br>
The emulator supports all ram card operations: reading, writing, formatting<br>
and write enable/write protect.<br>
It also supports ram cards of all sizes (128k, 256k, 512k and 1mb).<br>
The file format of a ram card is a simple memory dump; there are no headers or <br>
other information stored in the file.<br>
If files have been saved onto the ram card by the emulation, then the file<br>
on the host filesystem will be updated (the update will happen when MESS is exited,<br>
or a new card is inserted).<br>
Use imgtool to create blank cards, and to put/get files to the card image.<br>
At this time, only 1mb cards can be created and there is no support to create unformatted<br>
or executable cards.<br>
Do not forget to insert memory card (as "Cartridge"), and if you want to write files<br>
to it make sure it is write enabled (see dipswitches in UI).<br>
imgtool create nccard &lt;card name&gt;<br>
	Create a blank formatted memory card. The NC100 can write files to this.<br>
<p><b>	You can view the files by:</b><br>
		1. Pressing FUNCTION + B to enter BASIC, then typing "*." at the "&gt;"<br>
		prompt.<br>
		2. Enter wordprocessor menu and select list files.<br>
	<br>
imgtool put nccard &lt;card name&gt; &lt;host filesystem name&gt; &lt;nc100 name&gt;<br>
	Put a file from the host filesystem (e.g. PC harddrive) to the nc memory card.<br>
	The file will be cut if it is larger than 64k (64k is the maximum file size<br>
	supported by the nc100 filesystem).<br>
	At this time, all files are assumed to be ASCII. There is no support to put binary<br>
	or BASIC files.<br>
imgtool get nccard &lt;card name&gt; &lt;nc100 name&gt; &lt;host filesystem name&gt;<br>
	Get a file from the nc memory card to the host filesystem. Files are always<br>
	saved as binary regardless of file type on memory card.<br>
imgtool dir nccard &lt;card name&gt;<br>
	Show a directory listing of the memory card.<br>
imgtool del nccard &lt;card name&gt; &lt;nc100 name&gt;<br>
	Delete a file from the memory card<br>
c. SERIAL<br>
---------<br>
Serial is mostly working. <br>
MESS does not have a UI to change the serial device transmit/receive properties, so at <br>
this time it is fixed to: 9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity for the NC100<br>
driver.<br>
At this time, the serial device only supports a simple protocol. (Each byte is transmitted<br>
in a basic serial form, with start bits, data bits, parity and stop bits).<br>
In the future the serial device will support xmodem and xmodem send/receive will then<br>
work in the emulation.<br>
