<h4>Amstrad NC200 Notebook computer</h4>
The Amstrad NC200 Notebook computer is a portable computer.<br>
This system has a fold-down LCD screen, nice keyboard and disc drive.<br>
(The disc format is 720k PC Double Density DOS compatible).<br>
The memory is  protected by a lithium battery which is charged when the computer<br>
is connected to a mains supply.<br>
PCMCIA ram cards can be used to store programs and documents.<br>
The computer has a built in wordprocessor, BBC Basic, Serial Terminal,<br>
Calculator, Diary and more. The whole system is a personal organiser with lots<br>
of extras.<br>
<p><b>MESS Emulation State:</b><br>
a. ACCURACY<br>
The emulation is reasonably accurate. There are no documents about the hardware<br>
of the NC200. Originally Cliff Lawson published details but these have been lost<br>
when his WWW site went down. Since then he has been unable to write up the details<br>
of the hardware (Cliff is a very busy man).<br>
So I have worked out much of the NC200 hardware by disassembling the ROM and I have<br>
also had much help from Russel Marks.<br>
a. PRINTER<br>
Same state as NC100, please see nc.txt for details.<br>
b. PCMCIA RAM CARD<br>
Same state as NC100, please see nc.txt for details.<br>
c. SERIAL<br>
Serial is not working properly. It is almost at the same state as the NC100.<br>
d. DISK DRIVE<br>
Not working. I am trying to find out the details of the disc interface by looking<br>
at lots of disassemblies!<br>
