<h4>Sinclair ZX 81 / Timex Sinclair 1000</h4>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Sinclair ZX 81 was the successor of the ZX 80. It had the same characteristics as the <br>
ZX 80, it's main difference (except for the colour) was its higher level of integration: the <br>
ZX 80 used about 12 chips which had been replaced with a ULA in the ZX 81. This computer was <br>
very successful in Europe at the beginning of the 80's. A large range of peripherals were <br>
developed for the ZX-81, among them: 3.5" floppy disk units, high resolution graphic cards, <br>
RS232 or Centronics interfaces, and RAM extensions. The ZX 81 was sold as the Timex-Sinclair <br>
1000 in the USA. <br>
