<h4>Atari 800 Home Computer</h4>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by <br>
default. Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be <br>
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the <br>
scroll_lock key.<br>
The Atari800 driver now has two ROM slots. It really had two slots, so the code was modified <br>
to optionally read the second part of a 16K ROM from the second cartridge filename provided <br>
(right slot). The previous version had a800_cartridge_32k flag which was wrong. Cartridges <br>
are either 8K or 16K, so that was renamed to ..._16k too ;)<br>
Most disk and cartridge images should work, though some graphic issues may exist.<br>
The Atari 800XL driver (a800xl) is not currently working.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Atari 400 and 800 were the first home computers to use custom coprocessors and the first <br>
to use "sprites" and special video interruptions like display lists, features that will be <br>
implemented several years after on the Commodore Amiga. It offered high graphic resolution, <br>
lots of colors and great sound capabilities, more than other computers could do then! The <br>
two models had same characteristics, the 400 is the low-cost version, it has only 16 KB <br>
(instead of 48 KB), one cartridge port (two for the 800) and a membrane keyboard (a <br>
typewriter style keyboard one for the 800). <br>
