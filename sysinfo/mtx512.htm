<h4>Memotech MTX512</h4>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
currently, the driver requires cassette images to be stored<br>
in the following directory - <br>
roms\mtx512<br>
the cassette image is a flat binary image with the first 0x12 bytes being the<br>
original mtx header and the rest being the file data.<br>
A note about cassette naming schemes - so long as the filename of the cassette image is the same <br>
as that stored in the header, you should be alright.<br>
To run a tape image just type LOAD"&lt;image name&gt;" at the Ready Prompt.<br>
MTX basic is pretty much a standard dialect, so you should have no problems<br>
using it, but graphic handling etc is a bit esoteric.<br>
<br>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
Improving the tape support, because at the moment it is just a hack.<br>
Improve the TMS99x8 driver (appears the dirtyrect handling there is not<br>
quite right)<br>
RELCPMH Mode (CP/M Memory configuration)<br>
support for additional roms<br>
No Cassette Save support.<br>
No Printer support<br>
