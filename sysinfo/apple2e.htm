<h4>Apple IIe series</h4>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by<br>
default. Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be<br>
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the<br>
scroll_lock key.<br>
<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
Apple "][", Apple "II", Apple "//" - Which is correct?<br>
"][", "II", and "//" tend to be used pretty much interchangably for any model of Apple II<br>
computer, although, practically speaking, there are a few usages which may provoke a<br>
correction.<br>
"][" is the original Apple II symbol. It appears on all early II's and II+'s as well as on the<br>
Disk ][ drive. It is, easily, the most attractive and distinctive II symbol; but, it is also<br>
associated with old Apple II's. The "//" usage is generally associated with the "c" and<br>
newer "e" models.<br>
<p><b>The generally preferred machine designations are:</b><br>
Apple ][   or  Apple II for pre-][+ models<br>
Apple ][+  or  Apple II+<br>
Apple IIe  for non-enhanced IIe computers<br>
Apple //e  for 128k-enhanced IIe computers<br>
Apple //c<br>
Apple IIc+<br>
Apple IIgs or  GS  or best (if you have the fonts)  ||GS<br>
The Apple IIe (the "e" means enhanced) is the successor of the Apple ][+. It was a very<br>
great success and was widely used in schools (and it's still used today in some places!)<br>
It works under DOS 3.3 (the Apple II operating system) and uses 143 KB floppy disks.<br>
The Apple IIe was replaced with the Apple //e, which had an enhanced keyboard, a 4 MHz<br>
65C02 CPU and a 3.5" floppy disk unit.<br>
