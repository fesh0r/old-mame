<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Apple IIe is the successor of the Apple II+. It was a very great success and was widely <br>
used in schools (and it's still used today in some places !). It works under DOS 3.3 <br>
(the Apple II operating system) and uses 143 KB floppy disks.<br>
The Apple IIe was replaced with the Apple IIe+, which had an enhanced keyboard, a 4 MHz <br>
65C02 CPU and a 3.5" floppy disk unit.<br>
