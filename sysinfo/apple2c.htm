<h4>Apple //c Series</h4>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by<br>
default. Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be<br>
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the<br>
scroll_lock key.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
Apple "][", Apple "II", Apple "//" - Which is correct?<br>
"][", "II", and "//" tend to be used pretty much interchangeably for any model of Apple II<br>
computer, although, practically speaking, there are a few usages which may provoke a<br>
correction.<br>
"][" is the original Apple II symbol. It appears on all early II's and II+'s as well as on the<br>
Disk ][ drive. It is, easily, the most attractive and distinctive II symbol; but, it is also<br>
associated with old Apple II's. The "//" usage is generally associated with the "c" and<br>
newer "e" models.<br>
<p><b>The generally preferred machine designations are:</b><br>
Apple ][   or  Apple II for pre-][+ models<br>
Apple ][+  or  Apple II+<br>
Apple IIe  for non-enhanced IIe computers<br>
Apple //e  for 128k-enhanced IIe computers<br>
Apple //c<br>
Apple IIc+<br>
Apple IIgs or  GS  or best (if you have the fonts)  ||GS<br>
The Apple //c is the compact (the "c" means compact) version of the Apple IIe. It has the<br>
same characteristics but lot of features which are optional on the IIe are provided on the<br>
//c (floppy disk drive, 80 columns display, color display, 128 KB RAM), but unlike the<br>
Apple IIe, it has no expansion slots, so it is hard to add features to this computer. It<br>
runs either with DOS 3.3 either with ProDos and has the first version of QuickDraw in ROM.<br>
The Apple //c was originally designed to be a portable version of the Apple II, but it<br>
wasn't a stand alone system, it has no batteries and no LCD screen (Apple would soon<br>
release the items), it could also be used with a small 9" monochrome green screen which<br>
plugged into the unit. The Apple //c was mainly used as a desktop computer and<br>
was replaced with the Apple IIc+ in 1988.<br>
The Apple IIc+ unit was a direct response to the Laser 128EX/2.  Apple retrofitted the<br>
//c design to try to compete with Video Technology's high speed Apple II clone. The<br>
retrofitting is evident in the design of the motherboard.  The motherboard runs at 1Mhz,<br>
unlike the Laser 128EX/2.  In order to run its programs faster, Apple used a 4Mhz 65C02<br>
with 8k of high speed SRAM cache and licensed the accelerator design from Zip<br>
Technologies (makers of the ZipChip accelerator for the IIe and //c).  They built an<br>
accelerator into a 1Mhz motherboard rather than design a faster motherboard from scratch.<br>
The designers of the Apple IIc+ originally wanted to make a portable ||GS. Apple's<br>
management, bent on promoting the Mac, balked at the idea. At the same time, the<br>
Laser 128EX/2 made a quick design cycle mandatory. The result is an updated //c.<br>
Apple //c went under several revisions: you can discover which machine you are using issuing<br>
the command PRINT PEEK(64447).<br>
If 255 is displayed, you have the first, original model. This model is known to have problems<br>
producing accurate baud rates for serial communications.<br>
If 0 is displayed, you can use 3.5" drives, but you don't have the memory expansion connector.<br>
If 3 is displayed, you have the memory expansion connector and you can plug in extra memory.<br>
If 4 is displayed, you have the latest model with memory expansion connector and extra upgrades.<br>
If 5 is displayed, you have an Apple IIc+.<br>
The Apple IIc+ was the finest Apple 8-bit computer ever built, but lack of marketing,<br>
the apparent de-evolution in technology compared to the 16-bit Apple ||GS, and the<br>
aggressive sale of the Laser 128EX/2 made the IIc+ the most short lived of the<br>
Apple II models.<br>
