<h4>Apple //c Series</h4>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by <br>
default. Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be <br>
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the <br>
scroll_lock key.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Apple IIc is the compact (the "c" means compact) version of the Apple IIe. It has the <br>
same characteristics but lot of features which are optional on the IIe are provided on the <br>
IIc (floppy disk drive, 80 columns display, color display, 128 KB RAM), but unlike the <br>
Apple 2e, it has no expansion slots, so it is hard to add features to this computer. It <br>
runs either with DOS 3.3 either with ProDos and has the first version of QuickDraw in ROM. <br>
The Apple IIc was originally designed to be a portable version of the Apple II, but it <br>
wasn't a stand alone system, it has no batteries and no LCD screen (Apple would soon <br>
release the items), it could also be used with a small 9" monochrome green screen which <br>
plugged into the unit. The Apple IIc was mainly used as a desktop computer. The Apple IIc <br>
was replaced with the Apple IIc+ in 1988.<br>
The Apple IIc Plus unit was a direct response to the Laser 128EX/2.  Apple retrofitted the <br>
IIc design to try to compete with Video Technology's high speed Apple II clone. The <br>
retrofitting is evident in the design of the motherboard.  The motherboard runs at 1Mhz, <br>
unlike the Laser 128EX/2.  In order to run its programs faster, Apple used a 4Mhz 65C02 <br>
with 8k of high speed SRAM cache and licensed the accelerator design from Zip <br>
Technologies (makers of the ZipChip accelerator for the IIe and IIc).  They built an <br>
accelerator into a 1Mhz motherboard rather than design a faster motherboard from scratch.<br>
The designers of the Apple IIc Plus originally wanted to make a portable IIGS. Apple's <br>
management, bent on promoting the Mac, balked at the idea. At the same time, the <br>
Laser 128EX/2 made a quick design cycle mandatory. The result is an updated IIc.<br>
The Apple IIc Plus was the finest Apple 8-bit computer ever built, but lack of marketing, <br>
the apparent de-evolution in technology compared to the 16-bit Apple IIGS, and the <br>
aggressive sale of the Laser 128EX/2 made the IIc Plus the most short lived of the <br>
Apple II models.<br>
