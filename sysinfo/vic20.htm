<h4>Commodore VIC20 and VC20</h4>
<p><b>Cartridge Usage:</b><br>
Cartridges may have any of the following extensions: .bin .rom .a0 .20 .40 .60 .prg<br>
Files with boot-sign in it are recognized as ROMs. Some cartridges require more than one <br>
image (for example, defender.60 defender.a0).<br>
.20 files loaded at 0x2000 <br>
.40 files loaded at 0x4000<br>
.60 files loaded at 0x6000<br>
.a0 files loaded at 0xa000<br>
.prg files loaded at address in its first two bytes<br>
.bin and .rom files are loaded at 0x4000 when 0x4000 bytes long, <br>
otherwise they are loaded at 0xa000<br>
Note that .prg files are assigned to the quickloader (so you have to use <br>
the -cart switch when loading ROM images).<br>
<p><b>Cassette Usage:</b><br>
Cassette images with the .wav or .prg extensions as well as multiple .prg files <br>
contained within a zip file can be loaded. Zip files must be placed in the current directory, <br>
and the contained prg files are played in sequential order.<br>
The format for WAVs are: <br>
8 bit (16 bit may work, but hasn't been tested), mono, 12500 Hz minimum. This has the same <br>
problems as an original Datasette tape drive (the tone head must be adjusted to get working <br>
(no load error...) wav-files)<br>
Note that tape volume is DAC1 volume within the MESS UI On Screen Display Options (accessed<br>
with the tilde (~) key in the DOS version.<br>
Within the emulation, use LOAD or LOAD"" or LOAD"",1 for loading normal programs. Use <br>
LOAD"",1,1 for loading programs to a special address.<br>
<p><b>Diskette Usage:</b><br>
Disk drives are simulated at the moment, and only file loads from drive 8 and 9 <br>
are implemented. You can load a program file from the ROM directory (*.prg,*.p00)<br>
(This must NOT be specified on command line, start the vc20 emulation with no images specified)<br>
 <br>
You can also load a file from a d64 image (The directory command LOAD"$",8 is supported when <br>
using d64 images).<br>
Within the emulation, basic programs can be loaded with: <br>
LOAD"filename",8 <br>
Machine language programs can be loaded to their address with: <br>
LOAD"filename",8,1<br>
When a program is loaded, type RUN or the appropriate SYS call to start it. <br>
Note that several programs rely on more features not currently emulated (such as <br>
loading other file types, writing...) Some games also rely on starting programs in the <br>
floppy drive's processor (and therefore CPU level emulation of the 1541 is needed).<br>
<p><b>Quickloader Usage:</b><br>
A quickloader is available via the f8 key. It supports program image files <br>
with the .prg extension. This loads the program into memory and sets the program end <br>
pointer. It works with most programs. The program can be started by entering "RUN" in <br>
the emulation.<br>
<p><b>Miscellaneous Usage Notes:</b><br>
Note that the pixel ratio for the PAL version is about 13/10 ! Resolution 1024x768 is good, <br>
but only part of the screen is filled. 800x600 is acceptable. Better to define own display <br>
mode (when the graphic driver supports this). For an acceptable display under XMESS, you can <br>
use the following switches: <br>
-scalewidth 3 -scaleheight 2<br>
If you run into difficulty, be sure to start the emulation with the -log switch, and look into<br>
the error.log file that is created in your MESS directory.<br>
See "Keys (This Machine)" in the TAB/Options menu for key assignments. Some key usages of note: <br>
stop-restore in many cases will cause the prompt to reappear.<br>
shift-cbm switches between upper-only and normal character set (if wrong characters are on <br>
screen this often can help)<br>
run (shift-stop) load and start program from tape.<br>
The emulated light pen uses Paddle 3 x-axe and Paddle 4 y-axe.<br>
While a normal or well written program will work regardless of the video system (PAL or <br>
NTSC), if the screen is too wide right or low, or the screen doesn't fit in visible <br>
area or gameplay is too fast try using the PAL (vc20) version, instead.<br>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
Some PC-Keyboards do not behave well when two or more special keys are pressed at the same <br>
time (with my keyboard printscreen clears the pressed pause key!)<br>
The timer system only 98% accurate.<br>
The serial bus allows simple disk support, but no printer or other devices at present.<br>
No userport, no rs232/v.24 interface.<br>
No special expansion modules like ieee488 interface are supported in the expansion port.<br>
Image compatibility is quite high, see vic20.crc for a partial list. The emulation features a<br>
rasterline based video system which should be enough for all vic20 games and programs. The <br>
emulation supports the keyboard, as well as joysticks, paddles and lightpen, via the emulated<br>
gameport, and simple Disk and Tape support. The expansion slot supports RAM and ROM <br>
cartridges, though not special expansion modules (see known issues). For a more complete vic20 <br>
emulation, take a look at the very good vice emulator.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Commodore VIC 20 was the successor of the CBM PET. It was designed by Bob Yannes at CBM, <br>
he later designed the SID chip for the C64 and then went to Ensoniq to design synthesizers. <br>
The VIC 20 used the same microprocessor and the same Basic language as the PET. It was very <br>
popular in the early 80's. Commodore sold more than 1 million of this computer! A great range <br>
of peripherals were developed for this computer as well as a lot of software. When it became <br>
obsolete, Commodore replaced it by the Commodore 16 which had no success.<br>
Note that its name came from the name of its video chip VIC (Video Interface Chip) and <br>
its memory size : 5 KB RAM + 15 KB ROM = 20 KB ! The European VC20 stands for VolksComputer.<br>
