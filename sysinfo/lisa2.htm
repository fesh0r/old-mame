<h4>Apple Lisa</h4>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
This driver is still buggy. Neither the hard drive nor the serial port are supported. There are<br>
many other bugs remaining with MMU emulation. Only Macworks will boot.<br>
<p><b>When you boot up the Lisa, you can see a self-test progress indicator. At least one test will fail:</b><br>
you must discard the error message by selecting the 'Ignore' or 'Start-up from...' button. Then,<br>
you get a boot device menu. Select the floppy drive unit, since it is the only available device.<br>
If the mouse temporarily refuses to work, you may use the keyboard shortcuts Apple+2 and Apple+3<br>
(the Apple key should be mapped to Control; you must use the numeric keys on the main keyboard, not<br>
on the numeric keypad). If the computer does boot, you will see an icon representing a weird floppy<br>
disk with a cross (maybe it actually represents a twiggy disk).<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Lisa project started in the summer of 1979. At the time, the idea was merely designing<br>
a powerful business computer, with scheduled release in march 1981. After his legendary visit<br>
to the Xerox PARC research center, Steve Jobs realized the GUI was the future of computing.<br>
So, in March 1980, a GUI was added to the Lisa specs.<br>
Despite huge support from Apple, the project got behind schedule, and Lisa was introduced<br>
on January, 19th, 1983.<br>
The Lisa was an impressive computer for its time. It had TONS of memory (1Mb on Lisa 1),<br>
a high-resolution graphic display, and it was fairly expandable. Its OS (weirdly called<br>
"Lisa 7/7 Office System") featured a complete GUI, and full preemptive multitasking<br>
with memory protection (something neither Windows 98 nor MacOS offer!).<br>
Its 68000 CPU was one of the fastest microprocessor in its time.<br>
Unfortunately, Lisa was never too successful. It was quite expensive, and relatively few units were<br>
sold (possibly about 10,000 Lisa 1 and 80,000 Lisa 2). Little software was developed for it.<br>
Also, it was extremely resource hungry: it was reportedly slow, and its memory requirements were<br>
the major cause for its high price.<br>
On 24th January 1984, Lisa 1 was replaced by Lisa 2, with 3.5" floppies and several small<br>
hardware changes. In January 1985, Lisa 2 was replaced by Macintosh XL, which had a modified video<br>
hardware, and used a variant of the Macintosh system instead of the 7/7 Lisa OS. Mac XL was<br>
discontinued in May 1985 (although it was still available at much later dates). Rumor has it that<br>
an enhanced, 68020-based Lisa was in development when Apple discontinued the Lisa.<br>
Note that, contrary to a common belief, the Macintosh is not a mere offspring of the Lisa, since<br>
both projects were led simultaneously. While the Macintosh borrowed many ideas from the Lisa project<br>
(which had more financial resources), the reverse is often true, too: for instance, the Macintosh<br>
included a GUI from the beginning.<br>
<p><b>The significance of Lisa:</b><br>
Lisa is a milestone in the history of computing. Arguably, the Xerox PARC research center invented<br>
most GUI concepts (along with Object-Oriented programming and Ethernet) 10 years before Lisa was<br>
introduced. However, although Xerox research was public, and some Xerox Altos were actually sold,<br>
or given to universities, these experiments remained little known, and raised little interest.<br>
I guess this was because computing was mostly the field of highly-trained professionals who did<br>
not care about ease of use (you know, the same kind of guys who laughed at Macintosh and worshipped<br>
the early IBM-PCs). So, Lisa made the world aware that GUI could exist, all the more since Apple<br>
was a major computer maker. Also, Lisa (along with Macintosh, Atari ST and Commodore Amiga)<br>
introduced GUI to hobbyists and home computer users, which enabled GUI to live.<br>
