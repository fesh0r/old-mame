<h4>Mattel Intellivision + Keyboard Component (intvkbd)</h4>
<p><b>Usage/Known Issues:</b><br>
This driver is almost complete.  The tape drive is not yet supported.<br>
The keyboard component has two cartridge slots - one to replace the occupied intv cart slot, <br>
and one for new keyboard carts (BASIC).   If you want to use the BASIC cart at startup, you<br>
must specify it as the second cart, even if the first cart slot is unused. <br>
(ex. -cart dummy -cart basic.bin)  Some tapes require the BASIC cartridge.<br>
Also, there is currently no mapping to the normal intellivision hand controllers yet, when <br>
using the keyboard component.  This driver uses the full keyboard, to toggle to the standard<br>
MESS keys, hit scroll-lock.<br>
