<h4>Texas Instruments TI-99/4 Home Computer</h4>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
This TI99/4 driver is preliminary and could not be tested.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The TI99/4 Home Computer was designed and built by Texas Instruments.  About<br>
200 prototypes were built in 1978, it was first shown in June 1979, and TI<br>
started shipping it in October 1979.  It was replaced with TI99/4a in the<br>
summer of 1981.  It was first sold in US, then was available in Europe in<br>
early 1981.<br>
This computer was easy to use.  It displayed nice color graphics, and<br>
played sound.  It was highly expandable, too.  One expansion enabled the<br>
computer to speak.  Programs were generally on cartridges.  TI, which always<br>
tried to keep the control of program production, put an emphasis on games,<br>
education, and home utilities (home finance, etc.).  Incidentally, it was<br>
the first 16-bit home computer.<br>
The general architecture was odd.  The computer had only 256 bytes of CPU<br>
RAM, the remaining 16kb of RAM were attached to the video processor.  It<br>
had been designed to use some slow "GROM" cartridges, written in an<br>
interpreted language, "GPL".<br>
Due to these poor designing and programming choices, the computer was slow.<br>
The keyboard was uneasy to use, and there was serious bugs in ROMs.  Also,<br>
it wasn't until November 1980 that TI could build a TV modulator to attach<br>
the computer to a TV instead of a monitor.  Worse, the computer was awfully<br>
expensive for a home computer (more than $1000 with the monitor, more than<br>
dozen thousand units were sold.<br>
The design of TI99/4 caused many headaches to TI engineers.  It was first<br>
designed as a console, then an inexpensive home computer (which explains<br>
its slowness and kludgy design), then a hybrid (with remote I/R joysticks<br>
and keypads - which were abandoned at the last minute - and a cartridge<br>
port).  It was intended to use a TI-designed microcontroller, tms9985, but the<br>
processor was never actually produced, so engineers had to use a<br>
software-compatible, high-end (in 1979) tms9900 with tons of glue logic.<br>
Note that the processor software design was remarkably weird (no stack, no<br>
on-chip data register).<br>
