<h4>Corvus Concept</h4>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
The keyboard is not emulated fully.<br>
Hard disks, serial ports, and Omninet are not emulated.<br>
Only the original floppy controller (8" SSSD disks) is emulated.<br>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
The driver can boot from a 8" SSSD floppy image.  Start the computer and press<br>
'F' when the computer asks for a boot device.<br>
You may invoke the MACSbug debugger as well by pressing the key 'D'.  However,<br>
this version of MACSbug requires a terminal to be connected to the serial port<br>
to do anything useful, so you are out of luck.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Concept was announced in the spring of 1982.<br>
This computer uses a state-of-art (at the time) MC68000 CPU.  Its CCOS<br>
operating system is a variant of the Merlin operating system by Silicon Valley<br>
Software: it is a mono-tasking OS, with source-level compatibility with the<br>
UCSD p-system, and vague reminiscences of UNIX.<br>
The Concept has a bitmapped screen, which enables to mix text in any style and<br>
size with graphics, and some programs were reportedly WYSIWYG (which was still<br>
relatively uncommon at the time).  The system includes a primitive window<br>
manager, but don't delude yourself: it is no GUI.  The most original feature is<br>
probably the rotatable screen that can be used either in horizontal or vertical<br>
position: however you need to reboot the computer after flipping the screen. <br>
Another feature of interest is the integrated network support: the Concept can<br>
be used either as a disk-less network computer or as a full-featured personal<br>
computer, and you could connect Concepts, Apple IIs and IBM PCs in an<br>
heterogeneous Omninet LAN.<br>
Available programs were mostly business applications: word processor,<br>
spreadsheet, grapher, database, accounting...  Thanks to its large screen, its<br>
WYSIWYG capability and to the use of various hierarchical menus, the Concept is<br>
relatively user-friendly for a 1982 business computer.  There were also Pascal<br>
and FORTRAN compilers, a BASIC, a UCSD runtime, an 8080 simulator, a port of<br>
the CP/M OS, a version of SPICE to simulate discrete ICs, and even a paint<br>
program that could take advantage of a mouse.<br>
The price was about 4000$ for a bare 256-kbyte system in 1984 (1000$ for extra<br>
256kbytes, $750 for floppy, from 2000$ to 4000$ for hard disk according to<br>
size).<br>
