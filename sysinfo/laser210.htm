<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The laser 200 was the successor of the Laser 100/110 (which had only monochrome graphic <br>
modes).<br>
Adman Harbison says "The Video Technology Laser 200 (and the Laser 300) were marketed in <br>
Australia by Dick Smith Electronics and badged as the VZ200 and the VZ300 computers.  <br>
For memory the computers were exactly the same, although he can not be too sure.  <br>
Some of the peripherals that I got while I had such a machine were things like a 16Kb <br>
expansion cartridge, a printer/plotter which wasn't much bigger than those little <br>
calculators that print out accounts etc. and some joysticks. The trouble with these <br>
computers was that they tended to die after a couple of years use. But they were cheap and <br>
came with a few software titles."<br>
