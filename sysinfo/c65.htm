<h4>Commodore c65 (1991)</h4>
homecomputer under the keyboard to redo the commodore c64<br>
success (with good c64 compatibility)<br>
Never released, because the compatibility was not good enough!<br>
(Some prototypes! were sold)<br>
Project name was C64DX<br>
<p><b>Features:</b><br>
hardware emulation mode for c64<br>
 adapter needed for c64 cartridges (many should work)<br>
 only standard c64 keys plus cursor-up and cursor-left<br>
 CPU not full compatible (no illegal instructions)<br>
enhanced keyboard<br>
m65ce02 processor core (1 or 3.5 Mhz frequency)<br>
vic3 (4567) with additional capabilities<br>
 vic2 compatibility mode<br>
 graphic modes<br>
 80 column modes<br>
second sid audio chip (both 8580)<br>
uart 6511 rs232 chip<br>
special dma controller<br>
128 kb ram<br>
128 kb rom (kernel, editor, basic, monitor, characters, c64 roms)<br>
build in mfm floppy disk 3 1/2 inch double sided double density<br>
connector for second mem floppy disk<br>
special ram expansion slot<br>
rs232 connector (round din)<br>
no tape connector<br>
new expansion slot<br>
<p><b>MESS emulation state:</b><br>
rasterline based video system<br>
 quick modified vic6567/c64 video chip<br>
 no support for enhanced features, only 80 column mode<br>
 no CPU holding<br>
 imperfect scrolling support (when 40 columns or 25 lines)<br>
 lightpen support not finished<br>
 rasterline not finished<br>
no sound<br>
cia6526's look in machine/cia6526.c<br>
keyboard<br>
gameport a<br>
 paddles 1,2<br>
 joystick 1<br>
 2 button joystick/mouse joystick emulation<br>
 no mouse<br>
 lightpen (not finished)<br>
gameport b<br>
 paddles 3,4<br>
 joystick 2<br>
 2 button joystick/mouse joystick emulation<br>
 no mouse<br>
serial bus<br>
 simple disk drives (device 10 and 11, hang in c64 mode!)<br>
 no printer or other devices<br>
expansion modules<br>
 none (did there any exist)<br>
expansion modules c64 (adapter needed)<br>
 ultimax rom cartridges not working<br>
 rom cartridges (exrom) not working<br>
 no other rom cartridges (bankswitching logic in it, switching exrom, game)<br>
 no ieee488 support<br>
 no cpm cartridge<br>
 no speech cartridge (no circuit diagram found)<br>
 no fm sound cartridge<br>
 no other expansion modules<br>
no userport<br>
 no rs232/v.24 interface<br>
<p><b>Keys:</b><br>
Some PC-Keyboards does not behave well when special two or more keys are<br>
pressed at the same time<br>
(with my keyboard printscreen clears the pressed pause key!)<br>
shift-cbm switches between upper-only and normal character set<br>
(when wrong characters on screen this can help)<br>
run (shift-stop) loads program from type and starts it<br>
<p><b>Lightpen:</b><br>
Paddle 5 x-axe<br>
Paddle 6 y-axe<br>
<p><b>Discs:</b><br>
only file load from drive 10 and 11 implemented<br>
 loads file from rom directory (*.prg,*.p00) (must NOT be specified on command line<br>
 or file from d64 image (here also directory LOAD"$",8 supported)<br>
use LOAD"filename",10<br>
or LOAD"filename",10,1 (for loading machine language programs at their address)<br>
for loading<br>
type RUN or the appropriate sys call to start them<br>
several programs rely on more features<br>
(loading other file types, writing, ...)<br>
most games rely on starting own programs in the floppy drive<br>
(and therefore CPU level emulation is needed)<br>
<p><b>Quickloader:</b><br>
.prg and .p00 files supported<br>
loads program into memory and sets program end pointer<br>
(works with most programs)<br>
program ready to get started with RUN<br>
loads first rom when you press quickload key (numeric slash)<br>
when problems start with -log and look into error.log file<br>
