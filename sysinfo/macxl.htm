<h4>Apple Macintosh XL</h4>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
This driver is still buggy. Neither the hard drive nor the serial port are supported. There are<br>
many other bugs remaining with MMU emulation. Only Macworks will boot.<br>
<p><b>When you boot up the Lisa, you can see a self-test progress indicator. At least one test will fail:</b><br>
you must discard the error message by selecting the 'Ignore' or 'Start-up from...' button. Then,<br>
you get a boot device menu. Select the floppy drive unit, since it is the only available device.<br>
If the mouse temporarily refuses to work, you may use the keyboard shortcuts Apple+2 and Apple+3<br>
(the Apple key should be mapped to Control; you must use the numeric keys on the main keyboard, not<br>
on the numeric keypad). If the computer does boot, you will see an icon representing a weird floppy<br>
disk with a cross (maybe it actually represents a twiggy disk).<br>
If you boot MacWorks, you should eventually see a floppy disk icon with a question mark. At this<br>
point, it is time to insert a bootable Macintosh image: to do so, use the file manager or whatever<br>
osd equivalent you may have.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
In late 1984, Apple's financial health was questionable, and Apple came to the conclusion that<br>
it did not make sense to support both Lisa and Macintosh.<br>
Therefore, on 1st January 1985, Apple discontinued the Lisa. However, they released<br>
a program named MacWorks, which enabled a Lisa to run the Macintosh operating system.<br>
The same day, they introduced a new variation of the Lisa hardware, named Macintosh XL,<br>
which was a Lisa 2 whose video hardware was modified in order for it to display square pixels.<br>
Additionally, existing Lisas could be upgraded to Macintosh XL. This modification improved<br>
the appearance of Macintosh programs; however, it prevented the Macintosh XL from running<br>
the Lisa operating system, or any Lisa program, for that matter. Needless to say, it would have<br>
been very easy to patch the Lisa OS to support the new video resolution: this was simply not done,<br>
since Apple had discontinued the Lisa OS.<br>
Macintosh XL was not very successful: Apple discontinued it in May 1985, and the remaining<br>
stocks were sold to another company (Sun Remarketing) which did manage to sell them.<br>
Though ill-fated, the Macintosh XL was an interesting machine. It was slow, slower than even<br>
the original Macintosh, but it supported up to 2 Megabytes of RAM (while the original Macintosh<br>
came with 128kb or 512kb only), had a larger screen, supported hard drives units (which<br>
the original Macintosh could not do until the Hard Disk 20 was introduced), and it had three<br>
expansion ports (it was thus the first expandable Macintosh, more than 2 years before Macintosh II<br>
and Macintosh SE were introduced). A number of these was bought by developers who needed<br>
the hard drive and appreciated the larger screen (anyway, Macintosh development was originally done<br>
on Lisa, so the transition from Lisa Workshop on Lisa to Macintosh Programmer Workshop on<br>
Macintosh XL was a natural one).<br>
