<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Atari 5200 was introduced in 1982, and was actually designed to be a competitor to the <br>
Intellivision, before ColecoVision entered the market. Developed under the name of "Pam" <br>
(Atari, at the time, typically named projects after well-endowed female employees), Atari <br>
considered releasing it with that moniker; PAM in this case an acronym for "Personal Arcade <br>
Machine".<br>
The 5200 shared much of the architecture of the Atari 400/800 computers, but featured a <br>
different cartridge connector and completely different controllers. Non-centering analogue <br>
joysticks which offered a full 360 degrees of mobility, were both innovative and unreliable. <br>
Other controller features included a keypad, and a ahead-of-it's-time pause button.<br>
The Atari 5200 suffered from it's initial incompatibility with the VCS/2600 (an adapter was <br>
later released) and fierce competition from Coleco. When Warner Communications sold Atari <br>
Corp. to the Tramiels in 1984, they quickly removed it from the market.<br>
