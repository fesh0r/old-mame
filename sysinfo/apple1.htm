<h4>Apple 1</h4>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
Steve Wozniak, who worked for Hewlett-Packard at the time, wanted to build his own computer.<br>
He couldn't afford the Intel 8080 CPU (this CPU was very popular then, as it was used in the<br>
Altair 8800 & IMSAI 8080, but was pretty expensive), he would use the Motorola 6800 but it<br>
was also much too expensive. Finally he decided to build his computer around the MOS 6502<br>
(which was pretty compatible with the Motorola 6800). The computer was easier to use than<br>
the Altair: unlike the Altair, the computer has a keyboard and can display characters on a<br>
TV (the Altair uses LEDs for its display). The display was very slow, only 60 characters (!)<br>
were displayed each second.<br>
Steve Jobs, who made the game "Breakout" for Atari, with a little help from "the Woz", was<br>
interested in this computer. Together they created the Apple Computer Company and they tried<br>
to sell the computer. Paul Terrell, the owner of a computer shop, was interested in this<br>
computer, but fully assembled (the Apple 1 was sold "naked", no monitor, power supply,<br>
keyboard, tape drive, etc.) and with a cassette interface, which Wozniak designed. He sold<br>
it with the Basic he wrote soon after. They sold about two hundred of these units. This<br>
machine was so popular that Jack Tramiel of Commodore (!) offered to buy Apple, because<br>
Apple was, at the time, a major purchaser of MOS 6502 processors (Commodore owned Mos<br>
Technologies). Wozniak wanted $15,000 more than Tramiel offered, needless to say, the deal<br>
fell through. It was followed the next year by the Apple ][.<br>
