<h4>Sinclair ZX Spectrum (and clones)</h4>
<p><b>Usage Notes (TK90X/TK95):</b><br>
TK90X/TK95 add two commands to the Sinclair BASIC: TRACE 1/0 (E cursor, Symbol Shift+P) <br>
turns on/off the display of the line currently executed. UDG 0/1/2 (K/L/C cursor, <br>
Symbol Shift+X) controls the behaviour of the (guess what?) UDGs: when the parameter is 0/1 <br>
they restore their shape to accented letters used in the Portuguese language (still haven't <br>
discovered the difference between 0 and 1) while the UDG 2 command activate the built-in <br>
character editor: you can use the keys 5,6,7,8 +CAPS or Symbol Shift to plot/move the <br>
cursor, the A-U keys to select the UDG to edit or copy (with the shift keys), INVERSE <br>
VIDEO key to reverse the character. Maybe there are yet more command-keys, but I haven't <br>
discovered them yet. Curiously, the BEEP command has been renamed to SOUND: who knows why... <br>

<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by <br>
default.  Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be <br>
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the <br>
scroll_lock key.   <br>
