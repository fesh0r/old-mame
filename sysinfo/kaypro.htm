<h4>Kaypro IIx (kaypro)</h4>
<p><b>Usage/Known Issues:</b><br>
Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by <br>
default. Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be <br>
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the <br>
scroll_lock key.<br>
As of 37b4, this driver is once again working. <br>
