<h4>TM 990/189 University Board microcomputer with University Basic and Video Board Interface</h4>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
This driver emulates a TM990/189 with University Basic and the optional Color<br>
Video Board.<br>
You can use all the video opcodes documented in the University Basic Manual.<br>
The optional demonstration EPROM set includes demonstration programs.  They can<br>
be loaded with LOAD 0, LOAD 1, LOAD 2 and LOAD 3.  Some programs are supposed to<br>
do some user interaction, but they were set up in demo mode, so that you must<br>
edit the source code to run the programs: for instance, to play the brick-wall<br>
game, you must type 'LOAD 2', then '5 SP=0' to disable demonstration mode,<br>
then 'RUN'.<br>
There is one undocumented built-in Basic function that can be used if you have<br>
the demonstration EPROMs installed: JOY.  This instruction is not fully<br>
implemented in University Basic, and it relies on an assembly language<br>
subroutine located on the Demonstration EPROMs.  "JOY 0" reads the analog<br>
X-axis for joystick 1, "JOY 1" reads the analog Y-axis for joystick 1, "JOY 2"<br>
reads the button state for joystick 1, "JOY 2" reads the analog X-axis for<br>
joystick 2, "JOY 3" reads the analog Y-axis for joystick 2, "JOY 4" reads the<br>
button state for joystick 2.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Color Video Board was released in 1980.  It includes a TMS9918 VDP, a<br>
joystick interface, and two EPROM sockets.  The VDP enables to display colorful<br>
graphics on a video monitor.<br>
This board was not designed by TI, but an external society (Eyring Research<br>
Institute).<br>
