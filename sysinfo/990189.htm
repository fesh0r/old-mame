<h4>Texas Instruments TM 990/189 Microcomputer</h4>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
This driver emulates a TM990/189 with University Basic.<br>
This computer has a 10-character 8-segment LED display and a 45-key keyboard.<br>
Key mapping can be read in the TAB menu.<br>
Programs can be saved to tape with 'SAVE', and restored with 'LOAD'.<br>
The 10-char window can be moved horizontally with Shift+V, Shift+W, Shift+Y,<br>
and Shift+Z.  Previously typed characters can be deleted with Shift+M.  You<br>
can discard the current line, exit List mode or break program execution with<br>
Shift+9 (ESC).<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The TM990/189 University Board Microcomputer was designed in 1978 and probably<br>
released in early 1979.<br>
Its primary target was University computing courses.<br>
It was sold with a simple assembler & debugger, UNIBUG, and a 500-page<br>
textbook titled "Introduction to Microprocessor".  The UNIBUG program has not<br>
been dumped, and is therefore not available.<br>
TI additionally sold University Basic for the TM990/189.  It is a relatively simple<br>
Basic interpreter.  This program is emulated.<br>
