<h4>KC Compact</h4>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
Image loading is the same as for the Amstrad CPC series.<br>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by <br>
default. Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be <br>
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the <br>
scroll_lock key.<br>
Z8536 CIO is not emulated<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The KC Compact is a clone of the Amstrad CPC series, made in East Germany<br>
by VEB Mikroelektronik. It was made in 1989 to celebrate 30 years of the GDR<br>
(German Democratic Republic). Soon after the Berlin wall came down, east and west<br>
merged, and production stopped.<br>
The system contains a hacked Amstrad CPC 6128 Operating System and the<br>
Amstrad CPC 6128 BASIC. Unlike the CPC, this system didn't come with a built in <br>
disc drive or cassette unit, and did not require a special monitor. <br>
The base unit can connect to a TV through a aerial or scart lead. <br>
Not many of these systems were produced and they are rare.<br>
The Amstrad CPC had a gate array chip which contained the logic for the<br>
palette, mode display, rom paging,ram paging and interrupt<br>
system. This is emulated in the KC Compact using a lot of TTL logic chips<br>
and a Zilog 8536 chip.<br>
Hardware that was designed for the CPC systems should work on the KC<br>
Compact, however, since the KC Compact has a different<br>
expansion port layout, a adaptor must be made.<br>
