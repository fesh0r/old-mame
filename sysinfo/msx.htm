<h4>MSX 1 Class Computers</h4>
The MSX driver currently emulates the MSX1, international, UK, korean and Japanese models.<br>
<p><b>Not emulated:</b><br>
Printer port, diskdrives, megaRAM, Sound Cartridge (SCC+), MSX2, etc..<br>
<p><b>Cartridge emulation:</b><br>
The MSX has 64kB RAM, like most (by far) MSX1 computers. It is located in slot 3. Two <br>
cartridges are allowed: the first in slot 1 and the second in slot 2. So subslots aren't <br>
emulated (yet). <br>
The msx.crc file is important. The last field on every line specifies the type of ROM mapper. <br>
See msx.crc for more information.<br>
<p><b>Sound emulation:</b><br>
The standard sound chip, the PSG (AY8910) is emulated, so is the extension that was included <br>
in some Konami cartridges: the SCC. The keyclick (PPI) is also emulated, as is the FM-PAC <br>
(you'll need the fmpac.rom of the original Panasonic FM-PAC for this). Unfortunately the <br>
YM2413 emulation in MAME does not emulate the volumes correctly.<br>
Last but not least, the DAC in Konami's Synthesizer is emulated, and the SIMPL (DAC on the <br>
printer port). The DAC in Konami's Matjusushi is also emulated, but the driver lacks MSX2 <br>
support.  <br>
<p><b>SRAM in cartridges:</b><br>
A number of cartridges (Hydlide 2, Xanadu, The Game Master 2 and more) had on-board sram. <br>
This sram is automagically saved as a MEMCARD.  <br>
<p><b>Tape emulation:</b><br>
Unlike other MSX emulators, the tape emulation is not done by trapping BIOS calls. In our <br>
opinion this is an evil kludge; apart from that, our setup does have an advantage. Tapes with <br>
a custom loader (using direct access to the hardware) will work fine. It is done by saving <br>
the tape as a .wav file. In principle, you could record a tape to .wav, and load them into <br>
MESS.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
In the early 80's, there were a lot of home computers, Microsoft and a Japanese company <br>
called ASCII corporation (directed by Kay Nishi) decided then to create an industry standard <br>
for the home computers: MSX (for MicroSoft eXtended). The new standard was based on an <br>
existing computer: The Spectravideo SV 318. Microsoft designed the MSX 1 computers and the <br>
first version of the OS: MSX DOS 1 (which looks like earlier versions of MS DOS).<br>
Almost all Japanese and Korean computer companies made their own MSX computers (except <br>
perhaps NEC). Bill Gates was then very confident about the future of the MSX standard. <br>
Spectravideo (one of the MSX companies) made a 80 columns card and adapted CP/M on the MSX.<br>
A lot of software(especially a lot of games from Sega, Konami, Taito, Ascii,...) and <br>
hardware was developed for this standard. Despite all its qualities, the MSX family didn't <br>
have great success in USA, however was pretty known in Europe (Netherlands and France), in <br>
South America (Brazil) and USSR. This standard was replaced in 1985 by MSX 2. <br>

MSX system list compiled from the list by TRD, Manuel Bilderbeek & Alex Wulms. Thanks to<br>
Stefano Priore, for abridging it to MSX1 specific info.<br>
<p><b>Other Info:</b><br>
The MSX driver is very preliminary. Disk drive emulation doesn't work properly<br>
for example, and memory emulation isn't very good either. Various MSX1 models<br>
are emulated, and there is preliminary MSX2 support through the msx2 and msx2j<br>
driver.<br>
<p><b>The required bios dumps are available at:</b><br>
	<a href="http://www.file-hunter.com/">http://www.file-hunter.com/</a><br>
<p><b>Cartridges:</b><br>
The ROM mapper (which is specified with -rom x in fMSX) is autodetected but<br>
isn't perfect. So you should also install the crc files, which can be <br>
downloaded from the official mess site. With the CRC files, cartridges with<br>
SRAM or a DAC (like Synthesizer or Majutsushi from Konami) are detected<br>
properly.<br>
<p><b>Tape emulation:</b><br>
Tape emulation is done via .wav files; the actual sound the MSX produces<br>
is recorded / played back, making tape emulation more authentic. Because of<br>
this, you can record your existing tapes to .wav and play them in MESS. Make<br>
sure your record them at high quality (44100Hz, 16 bit and mono).<br>
.cas files are also supported but they're converted to sound by the driver<br>
on startup. There is no support for writing .cas files.<br>
While recording or playback you can hear the sound through the sound card<br>
of your computer. You can control the volume by pressing &lt;SCROLL LOCK&gt; and<br>
&lt;~&gt;. <br>
.tap files from Virtual MSX can be converted to .cas using imgtool (see<br>
imgtool.txt for more information).<br>
<p><b>Memory Emulation:</b><br>
The memory map is from a standard MSX1; there are no subslots, nor MSX2 <br>
memory mappers for RAM. RAM is 64Kb in slot 3, and slot 1 and 2 are where <br>
the cartridges end up.<br>
<p><b>Sound emulation:</b><br>
The PSG, PPI (key click), SCC are emulated. The SCC isn't perfect yet, you<br>
can hear slight imperfections in King's Valley 2 (when you through the knife),<br>
F1 Spirit (when you start a race), Solid Snake (when you get to building 3).<br>
The SCC is called `k051649' in the volume menu.<br>
The FM-PAC is also emulated for which you need the ROM dump of an original<br>
Panasonic FM-PAC. However the sound emulation isn't very good at all. :/<br>
The following DACs are emulated: SIMPL, Konami's Synthesizer, Konami's<br>
Majutsushi. The keyclick is also done through the DAC. To enable SIMPL<br>
(which disables the printer port), press &lt;SCROLL LOCK&gt;, &lt;TAB&gt; and go to<br>
Dip Switches. Here set SIMPL to "On".<br>
You can control the volumes by pressing &lt;SCROLL LOCK&gt; (so you go to UI<br>
mode) and then &lt;~&gt;. Press &lt;UP&gt; and &lt;DOWN&gt; to see different sound chips, and<br>
&lt;LEFT&gt; and &lt;RIGHT&gt; to change the volume.<br>
<p><b>Video emulation:</b><br>
The tms9928a (MSX1) emulation is very good, but doesn't emulate changes while<br>
the screen is being drawn to the screen. <br>
The v9938 emulation is preliminary and has problems with sprite mode 2 (MSX2<br>
games), interlaced mode, graphic engine emulation, timing (Zanac Ex doesn't<br>
run correctly and Aleste only runs in the Japanese version of the driver).<br>
Also the PAL/NTSC (50/60Hz) switch is an evil hack, the actual refresh rate<br>
of the screen isn't changed.<br>
Also it's not very well optimized, I'll start optimizing as soon as it<br>
works alright. <br>
The v9958 isn't emulated at all. <br>
The MSX1 and MSX2 video chips only only display a limited number of sprites on<br>
one line; this causes sprite flickering, you can turn this off (which isn't<br>
like a real MSX of course) by pressing: &lt;SCROLL LOCK&gt;, &lt;TAB&gt; and going to the<br>
Dip Switches menu. Set "Enforce 4/8 sprites/line" to "Off". Note that sometimes<br>
this feature is used for other purposes, like making sure a sprite is only<br>
partly displayed (when you enter a world in The Maze of Galious for example).<br>
<p><b>Printer port:</b><br>
The printer port is emulated; output to the port is saved to disk. However<br>
no emulation/translation is done, so the data is raw. <br>
<p><b>MSX2 RTC:</b><br>
The real-time clock, which keeps information like the time and date, should<br>
be emulated correctly. However in PAL mode the timing isn't correct as the<br>
refresh rate isn't properly adjusted. All settings are saved to disk.<br>
<p><b>Keyboard/joystick/mouse:</b><br>
The keyboard layout should be properly emulated. Joysticks seem to default<br>
to having key-bindings as well, so pressing &lt;CTRL&gt; or &lt;ALT&gt; will also work<br>
for the joysticks, but might give some unexpected results.<br>
The mouse emulation doesn't work properly yet. :(<br>
<p><b>Disk Emulation:</b><br>
Disks are emulated through proper wd2793 emulation. Currently only the<br>
Philips and Sony diskroms are supported; the Panasonic machines use the<br>
tc8566af diskcontroller (unemulated) and the Brazillian machines are <br>
port-based (not memory-mapped).<br>
You need a proper diskrom dump, and the msx.crc file in place. The diskrom <br>
should be recognized as type 15 otherwise the driver doesn't know it's<br>
a diskrom. <br>
Next specify the diskrom as one of the cartridges. That should do the <br>
trick. :) Note that only .dsk files are supported; other formats can<br>
be converted to .dsk using imgtool (it can convert .msx, .img, .ddi, .xsa,<br>
multidisks -- see imgtool.txt for more information).<br>
Error aren't properly handled yet. ``not ready'' is reported as ``record<br>
not found'', which results in ``Disk I/O error'' in MSX-BASIC.<br>
Also not that memory emulation isn't complete so MSX2 memory mappers<br>
don't work yet.<br>
