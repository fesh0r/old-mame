<h4>Rockwell AIM-65</h4>
Very early computer <br>
<p><b>Features:</b><br>
* Integrated 20 digit (16segment) display <br>
* Full size keyboard<br>
* Integrated printer<br>
* Connector for tty input/output<br>
* Tape interface<br>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
* Display and keyboard working<br>
* Usable picture of the display with its white frame as artwork would be nice.<br>
* Would suffer from support for intelligent terminals as tty equipment.<br>
* Stopped. For me it is much to cryptic to operate, and therefore not interesting for me anymore.<br>
