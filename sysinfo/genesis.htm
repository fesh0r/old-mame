<h4>Sega Megadrive/Genesis</h4>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
Under the "Options" menu, accessible by hitting TAB, you will find the following option: <br>
"Country" - this allows you to alter the 'flavour' of Genesis, to either European, Japanese <br>
or American. Many cartridges compare their country codes with that of the Genesis itself and <br>
may behave differently, or lock up if the two types do not match.<br>
'Auto' attempts to auto-set the Genesis country code to the value the cartridge will appear <br>
to be checking for. This may not be 100% accurate, however.<br>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
Most games tend to run fairly well. Some have slight graphic glitches, incorrect colours part <br>
way down the screen or other bizarre effects. See genesis.crc for a partial list.<br>
Cartridges up to 32MBit (4MByte) are supported.<br>
The controller may not work well with some games. This will be resolved when more information <br>
is obtained. Similarly, 6-button joypads aren't emulated yet.<br>
Split screen effects and interlacing are not yet supported.<br>
Sprite/layer priority should be perfect.<br>
Sound is emulated at Z80 and PSG76489 level. <br>
I still consider the Genesis driver extremely preliminary. I have a lot of further work to do <br>
before I consider it anywhere near complete. My initial goal is to make it as compatible as <br>
possible. Currently there is scope within the driver to handlesplit screen colour changes/any <br>
VDP effect, interlacing, without rewriting. The graphics renderer emulates VDP at scanline <br>
level, and does not use tile-based methods.<br>
Wanted: Any Sega Megadrive information! Information is extremely sparse; typically the same <br>
three-four documents, with parts incomplete, conflicting, and corrupted. Specifically, some <br>
of the finer points of DMA transfer, and access of the 68K memory map by the Z80. Generally, <br>
points which conflict with themselves in the documentation available on the net...<br>
