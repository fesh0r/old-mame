<h4>Sega Megadrive/Genesis (1988)</h4>
The Sega Genesis was released in Japan on the 29th of October 1988, and in the USA on the 1st<br>
of September 1989. At that time, no other console could compete with Sega´s powerful 16-bit <br>
system, apart from the PC-Engine / TurboGrafx-16, perhaps. But due to a lack of third-party <br>
support - especially with the arrival of the SNES, because many of the major game companies <br>
were still bound to Nintendo because of the contracts they made in the NES era - the Genesis <br>
never became as successful as Nintendo´s 16-bit console. Nevertheless, about 28.5 million <br>
consoles were sold worldwide, compared to about 48 million SNES consoles. Looking at the <br>
different regions of the world, the Genesis was most successful in the USA. It was quite strong in <br>
Europe, too (especially Great Britain is famous for being the European Sega stronghold), but did<br>
not succeed very well in Japan, Nintendo's home country. It was definitely no mistake to buy the<br>
console, as I did in early 1990, shortly after Super Shinobi had been released.  Among the <br>
approximetaly 1000 games which were produced during the genesis' lifespan (about 10 years <br>
during 1988-1998) are a lot of evergreens which deserve to be played even today. (note taken <br>

<p><b>Features:</b><br>
Main Processor: Motorola M68000 (16-bit) at 7.67 Mhz<br>
 <br>
Co-processor: Z80a at 3.58Mhz<br>
Sound Chips: YM2612 and a 4 channel TI PSG76489<br>
Ram: 64k (Plus 64k Ram for sound)<br>
Max Cart Size: ??<br>
<p><b>Video:</b><br>
Max resolution: 320 X 224 <br>
Color palette: 512; 64 max on screen<br>
Max # of sprites: 80; 20 max per scanline<br>
Sound: Stereo FM-based sound with 8-bit audio samples <br>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
Under the "Options" menu, accessible by hitting TAB, you will find the following option: <br>
"Country" - this allows you to alter the 'flavour' of Genesis, to either European, Japanese<br>
or American. Many cartridges compare their country codes with that of the Genesis itself and<br>
may behave differently, or lock up if the two types do not match.<br>
'Auto' attempts to auto-set the Genesis country code to the value the cartridge will appear<br>
to be checking for. This may not be 100% accurate, however.<br>

<p><b>MESS Emulation State:</b><br>
Most games tend to run fairly well. Some have slight graphic glitches; incorrect colours part<br>
way down the screen or other bizarre effects. See genesis.crc for a partial list.<br>
Cartridges up to 32MBit (4MByte) are supported.<br>
The controller may not work well with some games. This will be resolved when more information<br>
is obtained. Similarly, 6-button joypads aren't emulated yet.<br>
Split screen effects and interlacing are not yet supported.<br>
Sprite/layer priority should be perfect.<br>
Sound is emulated at Z80 and PSG76489 level. <br>
I still consider the Genesis driver extremely preliminary. I have a lot of further work to do <br>
before I consider it anywhere near complete. My initial goal is to make it as compatible <br>
as possible. Currently there is scope within the driver to handle split screen colour changes/any<br>
 VDP effect, interlacing, without rewriting. The graphics renderer emulates VDP at scanline <br>
level, and does not use tile-based methods.<br>
Wanted: Any Sega Megadrive information specifically, some of the finer points of DMA transfer,<br>
 and access of the 68K memory map by the Z80! Information is extremely sparse; typically the<br>
 same three-four documents, with parts incomplete, conflicting, and corrupted. Generally, points<br>
 which conflict with themselves in the documentation available on the net...<br>
