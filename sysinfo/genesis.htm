Sega Megadrive/Genesis (1988)<br>
------------------------------------<br>
Bios = None required<br>
The Sega Genesis was released in Japan on the 29th of<br>
October 1988, and in the USA on the 1st of September<br>
1989. At that time, no other console could compete<br>
with Sega´s powerful 16-bit system, apart from the<br>
PC-Engine / TurboGrafx-16, perhaps. But due to a lack<br>
of third-party support - especially with the arrival<br>
of the SNES, because many of the major game companies<br>
were still bound to Nintendo because of the contracts<br>
they made in the NES era - the Genesis never became as<br>
successful as Nintendo´s 16-bit console. Nevertheless,<br>
about 28.5 million consoles were sold worldwide,<br>
compared to about 48 million SNES consoles. Looking at<br>
the different regions of the world, the Genesis was<br>
most successful in the USA. It was quite strong in<br>
Europe, too (especially Great Britain is famous for<br>
being the European Sega stronghold), but did not<br>
succeed very well in Japan, Nintendo's home country.<br>
It was definitely no mistake to buy the console, as I<br>
did in early 1990, shortly after Super Shinobi had<br>
been released. Among the approximetaly 1000 games<br>
which were produced during the Genesis' lifespan<br>
(about 10 years during 1988-1998) are a lot of<br>
evergreens which deserve to be played even today.<br>

Sound: Stereo FM-based sound with 8-bit audio samples <br>
Usage<br>
----------<br>
Under the "Options" menu, accessible by hitting TAB,<br>
you will find the following option: <br>
"Country" - this allows you to alter the 'flavour' of<br>
Genesis, to either European, Japanese or American.<br>
Many cartridges compare their country codes with that<br>
of the Genesis itself and may behave differently, or<br>
lock up if the two types do not match.<br>
'Auto' attempts to auto-set the Genesis country code<br>
to the value the cartridge will appear to be checking<br>
for. This may not be 100% accurate, however.<br>

MESS Emulation State<br>
---------------------------------<br>
Most games tend to run fairly well. Some have slight<br>
graphic glitches; incorrect colours part way down the<br>
screen or other bizarre effects. See genesis.crc for a<br>
partial list.<br>
Cartridges up to 32MBit (4MByte) are supported.<br>
The controller may not work well with some games. This<br>
will be resolved when more information is obtained.<br>
Similarly, 6-button joypads aren't emulated yet.<br>
Split screen effects and interlacing are not yet<br>
supported.<br>
Sprite/layer priority should be perfect.<br>
Sound is emulated at Z80 and PSG76489 level. <br>
I still consider the Genesis driver extremely<br>
preliminary. I have a lot of further work to do before<br>
I consider it anywhere near complete. My initial goal<br>
is to make it as compatible as possible. Currently<br>
there is scope within the driver to handle split<br>
screen colour changes/any VDP effect, interlacing,<br>
without rewriting. The graphics renderer emulates VDP<br>
at scanline level, and does not use tile-based<br>
methods.<br>
Wanted: Any Sega Megadrive information specifically,<br>
some of the finer points of DMA transfer, and access<br>
of the 68K memory map by the Z80! Information is<br>
extremely sparse; typically the same three-four<br>
documents, with parts incomplete, conflicting, and<br>
corrupted. Generally, points which conflict with<br>
themselves in the documentation available on the<br>
net...<br>
