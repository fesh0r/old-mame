<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The game console commonly known as the "Bally Astrocade" was never officially sold by that <br>
name, having originally been released by Bally Manufacturing in 1978 as the Bally Professional <br>
Arcade. It was withdrawn rather quickly though, due to the success of the competing Atari VCS. <br>
A group of Pro Arcade enthusiasts under the name Astrovision Inc., bought the rights to the <br>
Pro Arcade and reintroduced it as the Bally Computer System, including the Basic casettrige as <br>
a pack-in. In 1982, the system and company was renamed Astrocade, once again trying to market <br>
it as a video game system. The system didn't last much longer, though; it was a product with a <br>
limited interest base even before the video game slump of the next few years.<br>
