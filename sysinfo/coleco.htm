<h4>Coleco Industries ColecoVision</h4>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
This emulation runs most cartridges accurately. Games requiring analogue controls (Steering <br>
Wheel, Roller Controller) are not playable. See coleco.crc for further compatibility notes.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The ColecoVision video game system was released in August of 1982 for a suggested retail <br>
price of $175 US. Similar at it's core to the MSX computers, ColecoVision had both superior <br>
graphics and more expansion capabilities compared to it's chief rivals: the Atari 2600 and <br>
Intellivision. Among the expansion module options were a hardware Atari 2600 emulator, and a <br>
Steering Wheel for driving games, both unheard of at the time.<br>
The competitive price, technical superiority, and perhaps more importantly, the inclusion of <br>
Donkey Kong as the pack-in cartridge, led to Coleco becoming an industry leader. With the <br>
emergence of the popularity of home computers, however, the console market seemed in jeopardy <br>
of losing it's share to the likes of Commodore and Apple. Coleco responded by releasing the <br>
Adam Family Computer as both a standalone unit and as an expansion to the ColecoVision itself. <br>
The Adam was a phenomenal market failure though, and Coleco pulled itself from both the <br>
console and computer markets just before the game market crash in late 1984.<br>
Telegames purchased the rights to the system, and many of the manufactured games, and released <br>
a clone, The Personal Arcade, in 1988. It was later re-released by them, as the DINA.<br>
