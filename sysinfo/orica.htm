Oric Atmos<br>
<p><b>Known issues:</b><br>
- The disc controller emulation is not exact and some programs may fail to load.<br>
- The cassette emulation is not exact and some programs may fail to load<br>
- Screen display should be accurate, but there might be some small bugs.<br>
- Tape programs are found but not loaded.<br>
- there are bugs in the Microdisc and Jasmin floppy disc controller emulation so some<br>
programs will not boot.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Oric Atmos was the successor of the Oric 1 and had almost the same characteristics. Its <br>
main difference with the Oric 1 was it's enhanced RAM (48 KB instead of 16 KB), the keyboard <br>
and the debugged ROM (the ORIC 1 had several bugs). Several peripherals were available: <br>
3" floppy disk drive, a small 4 colour plotter, a speech synthesizer and a Digital/Analogue <br>
converter. An external interface was needed to use joysticks. <br>
