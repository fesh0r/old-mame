<h4>Sord M5</h4>
This computer used cartridges. You can insert game cartridges, or if you want<br>
<p><b>to use basic, you can insert one of 3 basic cartridges:</b><br>
"BASIC-I" a integer based basic, "BASIC-G" a basic for graphics, "BASIC-F" a basic<br>
for floating point operations.<br>
<p><b>Cartridges:</b><br>
The Sord must have a cartridge to start up.<br>
- some cartridges may not work<br>
<p><b>Cassette:</b><br>
The cassette emulation uses .WAV sample files.<br>
<p><b>saving:</b><br>
save"cmt:&lt;filename&gt;" where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file. <br>
<p><b>loading:</b><br>
old"cmt:" will load the next file on the cassette.<br>
chan"cmt:" and run"cmt:" can also be used to load and run the next file on the cassette.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Sord M5 is similar in design to the MSX but not compatible with it.<br>
(It has the same CPU (Z80), a Z80 CTC timer chip and the same video chip, but <br>
a different sound chip and the I/O port assignments are not the same).<br>
In fact some MSX games have been converted to the Sord by enthusiasts.<br>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
- no memory expansion supported<br>
- loading from cassette does not work<br>
