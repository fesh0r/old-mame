<h4>Atari 2600 Video Computer System</h4>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Atari Video Computer System (VCS) was released in 1977 at a suggested retail price of <br>
alone.  Joe Decuir, Steve Mayer and Ron Milner designed the VCS.  The Atari VCS was <br>
developed under the project codename "Stella".  The VCS later became known, both commonly<br>
and officially as the Atari 2600 (from the model number CX2600).  It is rumored that the number <br>
2600 was chosen because 2600 cycles was a prominent long distance access tone, and that<br>
one of the developers had created devices that would trick pay phones into granting long<br>
distance access as a hobby.<br>
