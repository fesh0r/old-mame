<h4>Atari 2600 Video Computer System</h4>
<p><b>Usage/Known Issues:</b><br>
This driver is highly preliminary. It will load most 2k, 4k, and 8k Game Program images, but<br>
will only display graphics for some of them. The games themselves are not currently playable.<br>
Work is continuing on the driver however. <br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Atari Video Computer System was released in 1977 at a suggested retail price of $299, which<br>
dropped quickly as sales soared; about 340,000 systems were sold the first year alone. The<br>
VCS was designed by Joe Decuir, Steve Mayer and Ron Milner. The Atari VCS was developed under <br>
the project codename "Stella". The VCS later became known, both commonly and officially as the <br>
Atari 2600 (from the model number CX2600). It is rumoured that the number 2600 was chosen <br>
because 2600 cycles was a prominent long distance access tone, and that one of the developers <br>
had created devices that would trick pay phones into granting long distance access as a hobby.<br>
