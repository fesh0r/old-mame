<h4>APF Imagination Machine</h4>
The APF Imagination has the same hardware as the APF-M1000, but it is a computer.<br>
It has a keyboard and built in cassette player.<br>
An additional disc interface was available.<br>
In basic, pressing "FUNCTION" (currently mapped to CTRL) and a letter/number will display<br>
a basic keyword making it easier to enter programs.<br>
FUNCTION+Q = IF<br>
FUNCTION+W = STEP<br>
FUNCTION+E = STOP<br>
FUNCTION+R = READ<br>
FUNCTION+T = NEXT<br>
FUNCTION+Y = PRINT<br>
FUNCTION+U = END<br>
FUNCTION+I = LIST<br>
FUNCTION+O = REM<br>
FUNCTION+P = USING<br>
FUNCTION+1 = GOSUB<br>
FUNCTION+2 = LET<br>
FUNCTION+3 = DATA<br>
FUNCTION+4 = INPUT<br>
FUNCTION+5 = DIM<br>
FUNCTION+6 = FOR<br>
FUNCTION+7 = RETURN<br>
FUNCTION+8 = THEN<br>
FUNCTION+9 = ON<br>
FUNCTION+0 = GOTO<br>
FUNCTION+- = RESTORE<br>
FUNCTION+ENTER = CLOAD<br>
<p><b>For cassette:</b><br>
Use CSAVE"&lt;filename&gt;" to save a file, and CLOAD"" to load the file back.<br>
<p><b>For disc:</b><br>
Use SAVE"&lt;filename&gt;" to save a file, and LOAD"&lt;filename&gt;" to load the file back.<br>
You can use "DIR &lt;drive number&gt;" e.g. "DIR 0" and "DIR 1" to give a directory of the<br>
disc.<br>
Basic disk images with the ".APD" extension are supported.<br>
<p><b>Known issues:</b><br>
* cassette loading and saving is working<br>
* interrupts are not exact. I don't know enough about them, any info would be appreciated.<br>
* disc interface is working, but there may be some bugs.<br>
* keyboard is mostly working but some keys may be missing<br>
* keypad is not emulated<br>
* the M6847 emulation is very advanced *BUT* I don't think I have set it up correctly for the APF Imagination, therefore the graphics are wrong.<br>
* memory emulation is not complete<br>
