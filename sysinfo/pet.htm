<h4>Commodore PET series</h4>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The name PET, besides being a marketing ploy to imply a user-friendly machine, is an acronym <br>
for "Personal Electronic Translator".<br>
The Commodore PET 2001 was a great success. Three models were made : the PET 2001-8N with 8 KB <br>
RAM, PET 2001-16N with 16 KB RAM and the PET 2001-32N. They were conceived by Chuck Peddle who <br>
later founded Tandon.<br>
The CBM PET 3032 was the successor of the PET 2001-32N (and has the same characteristics as the <br>
PET 2001-32N), and the predecessor of the CBM 40000 Series.<br>
The disk drives were "Intelligent", which means that they were CPU driven (MOS 6502) and had <br>
internal RAM (4 KB) & ROM (16KB, which contains the DOS). The 4032 and the 4016 (the version <br>
of the CBM 4000 with 16 KB of RAM) were sold with a 80 column dot matrix printer (5x8 <br>
character matrix). This printer (4022) was an Epson printer with the Commodore name on it.<br>
The Commodore 8000 series was a "bundle". It was made up of the computer (most often the CBM <br>
8032, though other models were made), the 5.25" double disk drive CBM 8050 (500 KB, 77 tracks) <br>
and the bi-directional 132 columns, 160 CPS printer. The 8050 has two 6502's, 4 KB of RAM and <br>
12 KB of ROM (which contains the DOS). It was sold with Ozz - a Database, and a version of the <br>
spreadsheet "Visicalc".<br>
