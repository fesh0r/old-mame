<h4>Tandy Color Computer 3 (Hitachi)</h4>
First off, also read the history for the Color Computer, Color Computer 2 and Color Computer 3<br>
drivers. Much of the information there also applies to this driver.<br>
This driver is exactly like the coco3 drivers except the MPU has been replaced by a Hitachi<br>
6309. This chip has extra features not documented by Hitachi.<br>
