<h4>Sega Master System (1987)</h4>
The Master System (called Mark III in Japan) was Sega´s competitor for the NES. Though Sega <br>
constantly developed new (and good) games, the Master System never beat the NES. The MS was <br>
most successful in Europe, especially Great Britain, where most of the games were developed in<br>
the "final" days in 1993/94. Overall, about 6 million consoles were sold world-wide until the <br>
end of 1994. (note taken from www.eidolons-inn.de)<br>
