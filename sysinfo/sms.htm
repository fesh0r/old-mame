<h4>Sega Master System (1987)</h4>
The Master System (called Mark III in Japan) was Sega´s competitor for the NES. Though Sega constantly developed new (and good) games, the Master System never beat the NES. The MS was most successful in Europe, especially Great Britain, where most of the games were developed in the "final" days in 1993/94. Overall, about 6 million consoles were sold world-wide until the end of 1994. (note taken from www.eidolons-inn.de)<br>
