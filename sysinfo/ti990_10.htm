<h4>Texas Instruments Model 990/10 Minicomputer System</h4>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
The controller panel is not emulated yet.<br>
The computer seems to lock when running various installation scripts, and<br>
rebuilding the system.<br>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
This driver emulates a TI990/10 CPU with mapping option, 1Mbyte of RAM,<br>
a generic disk controller at TILINE base &gt;1ff800, a generic tape controller<br>
at TILINE base &gt;1ff880, and a 911 VDT at CRU base &gt;0100.<br>
This is enough to build DX10 or DNOS. I have been able to build a working DX10<br>
3.7 or 3.6 system from the relevant build and backup tapes. (Tape loaded as<br>
tape unit #1 and a blank disk image as disk unit #1 (with the SCOSTA flag<br>
at offset &gt;A4 set to &gt;0002, so that the build tape does not try to format the<br>
disk)). I have even managed to install the fun and games tape, and play pacman.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
Texas Instruments has been building minicomputers since the late 1960s through<br>
the 1980s.<br>
Around the summer of 1973, they started to design the TI990 as a successor to<br>
the 960 and 980 computers they were building at the time. In 1974, TI started<br>
to build the prototype of the TI990 series, the TI990/9.<br>
In 1975, they released the first commercial system, the TI990/10. It was<br>
a minicomputer built with TTL logic. Although it was a 16-bit CPU,<br>
it supported an optional mapper to expand address space from 64kbytes<br>
to 2Mbytes.<br>
The TI990 series development continued. In 1975 or 1976, TI started shipping<br>
the TMS9900 microprocessor, which implemented a subset of the TI990/10 feature<br>
set. Two CPU boards were built around the TMS9900: the TI990/4 (1976) and<br>
the improved TI990/5 (date unknown). These boards were much cheaper than the<br>
TI990/10, but they could only address 64kbytes, did not implement the memory<br>
bus fully (no DMA support), and could not run the DX10 OS.<br>
Around 1978, TI released the TI990/12, a higher-end TTL implementation, which<br>
was faster, and supported many additional instructions and features when<br>
compared to TI990/10. It was replaced with a revised but similar TI990/12LR<br>
computer in 1982 or 1983.<br>
In 1981, TI released the new TMS99000 microprocessor. In 1982, they replaced<br>
the TI990/10 CPU with a cheaper, smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient<br>
TI990/10A board built around the TMS99000 CPU. Additionally, they released<br>
an all-in-one Business System 300 (1982), later replaced with the Business<br>
System 300A (1984). Both computers included the CPU, RAM, video terminal, and<br>
hard disk/tape interface in a terminal case.<br>
The TI990 series must have been abandoned around 1985, when TI introduced<br>
the S1500 series built around a 68020.<br>
The TI990 computers were primarily used for business applications.<br>
Two disk-based OS were available. DX10 was a multi-tasking, multi-user OS.<br>
<p><b>DNOS (released around 1981) was similar to DX10 and mostly compatible with it:</b><br>
it supported extra features but it was bigger and slower. Neither OS could run<br>
on the lower-end 990/4 and /5 systems, but a kernel and various OS utilities<br>
were available as static-link libraries for embedded applications.<br>
