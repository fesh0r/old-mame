<h4>Atari 7800 ProSystem</h4>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
The Reset key "R" and Select key "S" are hard-mapped to the same location as the default <br>
Player 2 up and fire two, respectively. You will need to remap these manually to avoid<br>
control conflicts in some games.<br>
Most games work fine, but a few have graphic and playability issues. See a7800.crc for a <br>
full compatibility list.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
Originally developed in 1984 as the Atari 3600, the Atari 7800 Prosystem was released to the <br>
US market in 1986, in an attempt to compete in a revitalized home videogame market. The 7800 <br>
was actually designed by Gencomp as part of a lawsuit settlement (Gencomp had been sued for <br>
releasing a speedup chipset for Atari coinop Missile Command).<br>
The 7800 was compatible with pre-existing Atari 2600 game program cartridges, without the need <br>
for expansion modules or turning switches, but was also designed to use enhanced 7800-only <br>
cartridges such as the pack-in "Pole Position 2". (n.b., only the 7800-specific cartridges are <br>
currently supported in MESS.) Many peripherals, including a computer/keyboard and high score <br>
saving cartridge were planned but never released.<br>
Unfortunately for Atari, the system did poorly in the late 1980's market dominated by Nintendo.<br>
www.atari-history.com has this interesting anecdote: "In the summer of 1984 the first 5,000 <br>
Atari 7800's had just been built in the new El Paso assembly plant. The production line <br>
manager, Brad Saville was eager to meet with Jack Tramiel to show him the new flagship Atari <br>
video game console. The meeting ended abruptly as Jack Tramiel was quoted "Get your pollution <br>
out of here! We make computers now and we don't want your garbage." The line manager was fired <br>
2 days later. About 8-9 months later the line manager received a phone call from Atari asking <br>
him as to the whereabouts of the die molds for the Atari 7800. The ex-line manager responded <br>
that he did in fact know where they were and for $50/hour for about 200 to 300 hours of his <br>
time he would remember where they were and find them. The Atari Corp. representative who <br>
called was infuriated and informed the former production line manager that Atari's lawyers <br>
would be in contact with him. He never heard from Atari again."<br>
