<h4>Atari 400 Home Computer</h4>
<p><b>Usage/Known Issues:</b><br>
Requires full keyboard emulation. At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is enabled by <br>
default. Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key associated functionality may be <br>
disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT). The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the <br>
scroll_lock key.<br>
Most disk and cartridge images should work, though some graphic issues may exist. Note that<br>
the Atari 400 has less memory than the Atari 800, and some disk images may not work as a<br>
consequence; this is not a bug in the emulation.<br>
<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Atari 400 and 800 were the first home computers to use custom coprocessors and the first <br>
to use "sprites" and special video interruptions like display lists, features that will be <br>
implemented several years after on the Commodore Amiga. It offered high graphic resolution, <br>
lots of colors and great sound capabilities, more than other computers could do then! The <br>
two models had same characteristics, the 400 is the low-cost version, it has only 16 KB <br>
(instead of 48 KB), one cartridge port (two for the 800) and a membrane keyboard (a <br>
typewriter style keyboard one for the 800). <br>
