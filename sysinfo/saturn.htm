<h4>Sega Saturn (1994)</h4>
<br>
In 1994 Sega launched its new 32-bit console, just a few weeks ahead of its rival Sony Playstation.  The Playstation was much easier to develop for and quickly overtook the Saturn in sales.  While the Saturn was much more successful in Japan than it was in the US or Europe the lack of good software and strong competition from the PlayStation doomed the Sega Saturn to a fate similar to that of the Master System.  The CDROM based system did have some great arcade conversions such as House of The Dead and Virtua Fighter 3.  Despite being the first consoles with Internet capabilities (via the NetLink adapter), Sega was relatively quiet after the slow demise of the Saturn.  Sega turns its focus to the 128-bit Dreamcast a few years later.<br>

<p><b>MESS Emulation State:</b><br>
See source code for more information.<br>
Bios starts requesting pad data so maybe we are now in the time set area ????<br>
Need to emulate pad system, add more interrupts and get some grafix working so we can see exactly where we are at this current time.  Currently locks up waiting on (i guess) a response from the 68k CPU. Probably need to emulate this shortly.<br>
