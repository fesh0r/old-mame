<h4>Apple Macintosh 512ke</h4>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
Introduced on 14th April 1986, the Macintosh 512ke was essentially a Macintosh 512k with<br>
the same 128k ROMs and double-sided 800 KB internal floppy drive as the Mac Plus.<br>
It was sold as a poor man's Macintosh. Also, any existing Macintosh 512k could be upgraded to 512ke.<br>
(They could be upgraded to a Mac Plus, too, but this involved changing the motherboard.)<br>
Since this model was discontinued a few months later (in August 1986), it may have just been<br>
a way for Apple to get rid of its excess Macintosh 512 motherboard. Or maybe they realized that<br>
512 kb of RAM were not enough to run real-world Macintosh programs.<br>
