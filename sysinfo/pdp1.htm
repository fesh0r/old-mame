<h4>DEC PDP-1</h4>
Currently supports three images: Spacewar! (first computer-based video game),<br>
Munching Squares (minimalistic yet beautiful graphic demo) and LISP (programming<br>
language). I have OCR'ed and assembled the source code of DDT (debugger), but I<br>
am still looking for bugs in this program. No other images are known at the<br>
time of writing: I know there were a text editor (Expensive Typewriter), an<br>
assembler/linker (MACRO), and even a multi-user, multi-tasking operating system<br>
(MIT PDP-1 Timesharing System), but I have no idea where a copy of these<br>
programs could be found (except for macro1, which is should be OCR'ed soon).<br>
<p><b>This driver emulates a complete pdp-1 system, including:</b><br>
* operator control panel<br>
* perforated tape reader and punch<br>
* typewriter for keyboard input and printer output<br>
* optional type 30 precision CRT display<br>
* optional type 15 memory expansion control, with 64kwords of RAM (16 type 12 memory modules)<br>
* optional type 10 automatic multiply and divide<br>
The internals of the sequence break (i.e. interrupt) system are implemented,<br>
but no device has been set up to trigger an interrupt.<br>
<p><b>Usage Notes:</b><br>
PDP-1 currently supports a perforated tape reader (punchtape unit #1), a perforated tape punch<br>
(punchtape unit #2), and a typewriter (printer unit #1).<br>
The simplest way to load and run software is to insert a read-in mode tape (.rim files) in<br>
the perforated tape reader and press the read-in switch once (press simultaneously the Control<br>
Panel key (Left Control) and the Read In key (main keypad Return)).<br>
Three dip switches (RAM size, Hardware multiply and Hardware divide) enable or disable computer<br>
extensions. These switches are only read at reset. Therefore, if you edit them, you must reset<br>
the emulator (press F3 in partial keyboard emulation mode) for the changes to be taken into<br>
account.<br>
<p><b>The "RAM size" switch installs and removes type 15 memory expansion control:</b><br>
it is disabled when set on 4kw, enabled with 15-bit addresses when set on<br>
32kw, and enabled with 16-bit addresses when set on 64kw. All known programs<br>
work well whether memory expansion control is installed or not. Only LISP can<br>
take advantage of the extra RAM.<br>
The "Hardware multiply" and "Hardware divide" switches enable or disable<br>
the automatic multiply/divide extension. When they are enabled, two pdp-1<br>
machine instructions (namely MUS and DIS) are replaced with two other,<br>
incompatible, instructions (MUL and DIV, respectively). Therefore, programs<br>
which use the former variant of these instructions require automatic<br>
multiply/divide to be disabled, whereas programs which use the latter require<br>
it to be enabled. In practice, Spacewar! requires automatic multiply and<br>
divide to be DISABLED (i.e. both switches OFF), whereas LISP requires<br>
automatic multiply and divide to be ENABLED (i.e. both switches ON).<br>

<p><b>History and Trivia :</b><br>
In 1957, Kenneth Olsen and Harlan Anderson founded a society called Digital Equipment<br>
Corporation (DEC).<br>
In 1960, they started selling the pdp-1. This was a very interesting computer for its time.<br>
First of all it was cheap and fast for its time: about 100,000 dollars, and a theoretical maximum<br>
of 0.1 MIPS. It included 4 kWords of RAM, expandable to 64 kWord (as word size is 18 bits,<br>
this makes from 9 to 144 kBytes, which is HUGE for this time): this is an important detail, since,<br>
at this time, cheap computers (e.g. IBM 650) often had no RAM, and used a magnetic drum instead,<br>
which implied extremely long memory access times.<br>
What made it even more interesting was that it was designed to be operated interactively.<br>
It featured an on-line typewriter (i.e. keyboard and printer), and a CRT (which was seldom used<br>
as a computer device at this time). You could even buy an optional light-pen (this device was<br>
the closest equivalent to today's mouse). Along with its simplicity, this made the pdp-1 quite<br>
user-friendly for its time.<br>
The pdp-1 may be regarded as one of the first personal computers, since one person was quite<br>
enough to run and operate it (although, needless to say, its price was not the kind of price<br>
you would expect from a personal computer today).<br>
The pdp-1 attracted the attention of various hackers in MIT. This resulted into the creation<br>
of Spacewar!, which was the first computer-based videogame, but this is another story.<br>
The pdp-1 was a reasonably successful machine: 49 units were sold, which was not as bad as it<br>
sounds for this time. DEC intended to sell variants of pdp-1 with a bigger word size<br>
(pdp-3 with 36-bit words, and possibly other variants (pdp-2???) with 24-bit or 30-bit words),<br>
but it eventually did not. However, it later replaced pdp-1 with other models, including the first<br>
minicomputer (the pdp-8 in 1965), and, by the early 1970's, it had become a major computer<br>
manufacturer, second only to IBM.<br>
