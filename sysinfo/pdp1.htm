Currently emulates one image - SPACEWAR!<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia :</b><br>
Note : I borrowed most details from an article by J. M. Graetz called "The origin of Spacewar".<br>
This article can be found at &lt;<a href="http://www.enteract.com/~enf/lore/spacewar/spacewar.html&gt;,">http://www.enteract.com/~enf/lore/spacewar/spacewar.html&gt;,</a><br>
and was originally printed in the August 1981 issue of Creative Computing magazine.<br>
Early computers, particularly mainframes, were Complex Devices to be operated by Competent People<br>
helped by dozens of Servants who typed the Data and fed it to the Computer. Outsiders who visited to<br>
see computers were often disappointed : there was nothing to SEE, these machine were just crunching<br>
numbers on paper tape, and printing further numbers on another tape.<br>
In the fall of 1961, Digital started production of its PDP-1. This machine was quite friendly<br>
for its time : it was compact enough to be located in the corner of a room, and you did not need to<br>
know hundreds of pages of procedures to switch it on and off. Additionally, it supported<br>
an optional CRT screen, which was a rare device at this time.<br>
PDP-1 may be regarded as one of the first minicomputers, although it did not include and integrated<br>
circuit (which hardly existed at this time). It may be regarded as one of the first personal<br>
computers, too, since one person was quite enough to run and operate it (although, needless to say,<br>
its price was not the kind of price you would expect from a personal computer today).<br>
One of the first PDP-1 was installed at the MIT. Needless to say, the various hackers of the MIT<br>
immediately felt attracted to this machine. And this is how the adventure of Spacewar! began.<br>
Let it be clear that there were already computers games : a game of Tic-Tac-Toe and simple games<br>
of cards existed as early as in 1955. Attempts at implementing a game of chess can be traced back<br>
to the early 1950s.<br>
Yet, the use of CRT enabled the development of a new breed of real-time, action games. Several<br>
real-time, funny demonstration programs had already written for earlier machines : the Bouncing<br>
Ball, in which a ball fell from the top of the screen and bounced ; the Mouse in the Maze which<br>
enabled the user to draw a maze and place a piece of cheese with a lightpen : a mouse would enter<br>
the maze, search the cheese and eat it. However, these were no "real" video games as far as there<br>
was no real-time action.<br>
There were three fellows who came with the initial idea of Spacewar! : Wayne Witanen,<br>
J. Martin Graetz, and Stephen R. (Slug) Russell. They were about 25-year-old. They wanted to devise<br>
an attractive demonstration program, which used as much the computer resources as possible,<br>
so they came out with the idea of a video game. The basic idea was to have two players fly<br>
a spaceship and fight each other with torpedoes. It was somewhat inspired by Science-Fiction<br>
novels and films these fellow had read and watched. Soon, most hackers at the MIT knew about<br>
this project.<br>
Since there was no development tool, they had to wait for a text editor, assembler and debugger<br>
to be ported to PDP-1.<br>
Eventually, in January 1962, the development started, and by February, a crude version of the game<br>
was already running. The development continued, as they added a star background, a big central star<br>
with the associated gravitic effects, and an hyperspace jump device. The game was essentially<br>
complete by the end of April 1962, so that it was shown MIT's annual Science Open House in May.<br>
Needless to say, it was a hit. Soon, program tapes with Spacewar! were circulating in the<br>
universities around the USA.<br>
<p><b>What else can we say ? These people thought that computer games would make computers more popular :</b><br>
the least we can say is they were right. Spacewar! is the first video game, and as such it is<br>
the ancestor of thousands of arcade, console or computer games with hairy aliens, missiles,<br>
and action. Although it took about 10 additional years for video games to go commercial,<br>
we can say that it all started with Spacewar!.<br>
