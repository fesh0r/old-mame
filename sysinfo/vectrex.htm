<h4>GCE Vectrex</h4>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
Though the Vectrex emulation can be loaded with a cartridge image, starting without one will<br>
allow you to access the built-in game Minestorm (provided the system.img bios is present).<br>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
No light pen support.<br>
Almost every cartridge is playable, except those requiring the light pen. See vectrex.crc for <br>
a current compatibility list. Overlays are supported in .png format, using the same name as <br>
the cartridge image being loaded. Place overlays in the artwork directory. The overlay for<br>
the built in minestorm game must be named "mine.png" to load when no image is selected.<br>
Current Bug -- The vectrex overlays have not worked in the 37 beta cycle. This is being <br>
looked into.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Vectrex was released in the US late in 1982 by General Consumer Electric (GCE) at a <br>
suggested retail price of $199. The Vectrex differed from other consoles in that it had <br>
it's own built in nine inch by eleven inch vector monitor, and thus didn't require (or <br>
even allow) the use of a television set. The system even contained a built in game, the <br>
Asteroids-like "Minestorm". <br>
The monochrome Vectrex used screen overlays to give the illusion of colour, and also to <br>
reduce the severity of the inherent flickering caused by the vector monitor.<br>
In 1983, GCE was merged into Milton Bradley, who expanded the Vectrex's market to include <br>
Europe. As the video game market declined and then crashed, the Vectrex exited the market <br>
in early 1984. The rights to the system reverted to it's developers, Smith Engineering. <br>
Smith Engineering briefly considered designing a handheld version of the device in 1988, <br>
though the success of the Nintendo Game Boy made such a project too risky. In the mid-1990s, <br>
Smith Engineering condoned the duplication of the Vectrex system image and cartridges for <br>
non-commercial uses.<br>
