<h4>Tomy Tutor (a.k.a. Grandstand Tutor)</h4>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
Cassette emulation does not work.<br>
<br>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
<p><b>The Tutor has three built-in programs:</b><br>
* Graphic is a Picture drawing program.  It enables you to create 256*192<br>
pictures in 16 colors, but the interface is awkward and I don't think the<br>
pictures drawn in this program can be saved.<br>
* Basic is a Basic interpreter derived from the TI99 Extended Basic.  Quite<br>
unfortunately, Basic lacks I/O routines and a serious graphic library.<br>
* GBasic is another Basic interpreter that is hidden in Graphic.  It is<br>
probably faster than Basic and has better graphic capabilities, but the<br>
language itself is unfortunately lacking.  And the editor simply sucks.<br>
A few cartridges were released: almost 40 games and a few educational programs.<br>
9 cartridges are known to have been dumped (8 games and an educational title).<br>
<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
This computer is known as Tomy Tutor in US, and as Grandstand Tutor in UK.  It<br>
was initially released in Japan in 1982 or 1983 under the name of Pyuuta<br>
(Pi-yu-u-ta, with a Kanji for the "ta").  The Japanese versions are different<br>
from the English-language versions, as they have different ROMs with Japanese<br>
<p><b>messages and support for the katakana syllabus.  There are at least 4 versions:</b><br>
* original Pyuuta (1982 or 1983) with title screens in Japanese but no Basic<br>
(only the toy-like Gbasic interpreter is available)<br>
* Pyuuta Jr. (1983?) which is a console with a simplified keyboard<br>
* Tomy/Grandstand Tutor (circa October 1983?) with title screens in English and<br>
integrated Basic<br>
* Pyuuta Mk. 2 (1984?) with a better-looking keyboard and integrated Basic<br>
The Tutor was not extremely successful, probably due to the fact that little<br>
software was available (and that the software that was available was not varied<br>
enough).<br>
One question that remains open is the relationship between the Tutor and the<br>
TI-99 series.  From a hardware point of view, the Tutor has a lot in common<br>
with TI-99/4(a) (though the two computers are NOT compatible).  From a<br>
software point of view, the Tutor Basic is directly derived from TI Extended<br>
Basic (there is even a GPL interpreter in ROM, though the Tutor variant of GPL<br>
is quite different from TI GPL).  However, other Tutor software do not seem to<br>
be derived from TI-99 software.  It is therefore likely that Matsushita<br>
designed the Tutor independently from TI and licenced the TI Basic from TI as<br>
an afterthought; OTOH, the whole design might have originated from TI, as the<br>
computer really looks like a "TI-99/3" (the hardware is similar to the TI-99/4<br>
series, whereas the concept is very close to the TI-99/2).<br>
