<h4>Atari Lynx (1989) and Atari Lynx II (1990)</h4>
The Lynx was the world's first hand-held color video game system.  Sold by Atari (developed by <br>
Epyx a few years earlier), the Lynx offered true multi-player competition, built-in 3D and <br>
distortion graphic effects, reversible controls, and fast arcade action.  The system featured <br>
some accurate arcade translations such as Joust, Rampart, and Klax.  The Lynx II is a lightweight<br>
redesign and features stereo sound and shorter power down timer.  Around 1993 Atari ceased marketing<br>
the Lynx and focused on their new console, the Jaguar. (Notes taken from FAQ and Atari Age)<br>
