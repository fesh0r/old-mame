<h4>Texas Instruments TI-99/4a Home Computer</h4>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
Requires full keyboard emulation.  At startup, full keyboard emulation mode is<br>
enabled by default.  Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, some key<br>
associated functionality may be disabled (like the ESC key for EXIT).<br>
The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the scroll_lock key.<br>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
This TI99/4a driver offers a high level of compatibility. It currently<br>
supports V9t9-format cartridge images, sampled tapes in wave format<br>
(CS1 and CS2), and up to 3 SSSD disk images. Speech synthesis is emulated,<br>
although speech ROM emulation is still in the works. TI, Super AMS and<br>
Foundation memory expansion cards are supported.<br>
<p><b>Loading a cartridge:</b><br>
You do not need a cartridge image to run the computer, since TI99/4a has<br>
a small built-in basic interpreter.<br>
V9t9-format cart images are typically split into up to 3 files. These can be<br>
loaded in any order, so long as all necessary portions are loaded.<br>
<p><b>Setting up the system configuration:</b><br>
A few dip switches enable or disable computer extensions. These switches are<br>
only read at reset. Therefore, if you edit them, you must reset the emulator<br>
(press F3 in partial keyboard emulation mode) for the changes to be taken<br>
into account.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The TI99/4a Home Computer was a TI99/4 with improved keyboard, revised<br>
ROMs, and an additional graphics mode.  It was officially introduced in<br>
June 1981, and was retired in late 1983.<br>
TI99/4a was quite successful in Europe and US (possibly hundreds of<br>
thousand units built).  In 1983, though, competition on the home computer<br>
market was so harsh that TI had to cut down the price of TI99/4a to less<br>
than $100, while suffering heavy losses.  So, by the end of 1983, TI had<br>
abandoned TI99/4a, its prototype successors, and withdrawn from the home<br>
computer market.<br>
