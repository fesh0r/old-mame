<h4>Oric 1</h4>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
This British computer was one of the most popular computers in Europe in early 80's, and a <br>
competitor of the Sinclair Spectrum. The two models (16 and 48) had the same technical <br>
characteristics, but the model 48 was sold with FORTH language. A small plotter was available <br>
for this computer. Note that the sound chip was the same as the one in the Amstrad CPC, <br>
MSX computers and Atari ST! The Oric 1's ROM was very bugged though, and it was replaced with <br>
the Oric Atmos.<br>
