<h4>Texas Instruments TI-99/4a Home Computer with SNUG EVPC video card</h4>
See the TI99/4a driver for non-EVPC information.<br>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
EVPC emulation is not complete.  The palette chip is not emulated.<br>
The computer may crash on soft reset, though I have no idea why.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
A common hack on the ti99/4a is replacing the old tms9918/9928/9929a with<br>
an improved, upward-compatible v9938.  This enhanced vdp supports true 16-<br>
and 256-color graphic modes, high-res 512*192 graphic and 80-column text<br>
modes, accelerated 2D graphics, etc.  The only drawback is that some programs<br>
(including TI's own TI BASIC) will not run with the v9938.  Also, only<br>
specially designed programs can take advantage of the improved graphic modes.<br>
The EVPC card does just that: it includes a v9938 with 128kb of VRAM, 64kb of<br>
extended RAM, an additional palette chip to program the palette in 256-color<br>
mode, and a DSR ROM with various useful subroutines.<br>
Also, this driver uses a hacked TI BASIC GROM so that TI BASIC will work<br>
normally with the v9938.  Only two bytes were modified to derive file<br>
"994agr38.bin" from file "994agrom.bin": the bytes &gt;F0 &gt;0C &gt;F8 at offset &gt;216C<br>
of the file were changed to &gt;00 &gt;0C &gt;00.  (This fix was contributed by Tony<br>
Knerr, but I have no idea who invented it first.)<br>
