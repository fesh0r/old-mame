<h4>Texas Instruments TI-99/4a Home Computer with SNUG EVPC video card</h4>
See the TI99/4a driver for non-EVPC information.<br>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
EVPC emulation is not complete.  The palette chip is not emulated.<br>
Also, TI BASIC will not run under this driver, though it might be normal<br>
(I know there are some bugs in the TI's system ROMs which prevent them<br>
from running with a v9938).<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
A common hack on the ti99/4a is replacing the old tms9918/9928/9929a with<br>
a higher-end, upward-compatible v9938. This enhanced vdp supports true 16-<br>
and 256-color graphic modes, high-res 512*192 graphic and 80-column text<br>
modes, accelerated 2D graphics, etc. The only drawback is that some programs<br>
(including TI's system ROMs) will not run with the v9938.<br>
The EVPC card does just that: it includes a v9938 with 128kb of VRAM, 64kb of<br>
extended RAM, an additional palette chip to program the palette in 256-color<br>
mode, and a DSR ROM with various useful subroutines.<br>
