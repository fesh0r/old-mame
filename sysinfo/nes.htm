<h4>Nintendo Entertainment System / Famicom (1985 USA)</h4>
The Nintendo Entertainment System (called Famicom in Japan) was an instant hit with such popular<br>
titles as Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda and Excitebike.  It was released to the states<br>
in August, 1985. The 8-bit graphics were far superior to any-home based console that had come <br>
before it. Strong sales were were driven by the gamers wanting the feeling of real-life arcade<br>
games in their homes.<br>
The NES boasts an impressive library of games with over 8000 games (Cowering goodnes), offering<br>
a smorgasbord of titles for fans of every genre. The Nintendo continued it's reign with other <br>
big hits such as The Mega Man series, Ninja Gaiden, Contra, Castlevania, Double Dragon and of <br>
course, Super Mario Bros 3.  The NES continued it's strong sales with over 36 million units sold<br>
worldwide by its official cancellation in January 1996 but not before releasing a redesigned NES. <br>

<p><b>MESS Emulation State:</b><br>
The NES driver should run most of the images currently out there with very little problem.  It doesn't yet support the obscure one-game mappers used by many "pirate carts".<br>
The NES driver has quite accurate sound and sample playback. For example, you can hear speech samples in Bayou Billy, Gauntlet, Dirty Harry, and Skate or Die that are not present in a few other NES emulators.<br>
The main focus up until this point has been in getting the NES driver as accurate as possible.  Unfortunately, the scanline rendering method is quite slow, so future efforts will be focusing on bringing up the speed.<br>
Wanted: I'd appreciate any info on some of the more obscure mappers. If you have any of this, please drop me a line at bradman@pobox.com<br>
