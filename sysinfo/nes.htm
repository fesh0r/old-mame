<h4>Nintendo Entertainment System/Famicom</h4>
<p><b>Usage:</b><br>
Note that the one player hand controller Select is mapped as Coin 1 (default key 5), and <br>
Start is mapped as Player 1 Start (default key 1). This makes it convenient to use the driver<br>
with a "MAME" configured controller.<br>
Famicom Disk System switching is mapped to Player 1 Button 3 (default key [space]).<br>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
The NES driver should run most of the images currently out there with very little problem.<br>
It doesn't yet support the obscure one-game mappers used by many "pirate carts".<br>
The NES driver has quite accurate sound and sample playback. For example, you can hear speech <br>
samples in Bayou Billy, Gauntlet, Dirty Harry, and Skate or Die that are not present in a <br>
few other NES emulators.<br>
The main focus up until this point has been in getting the NES driver as accurate as <br>
possible. Unfortunately, the scanline rendering method is quite slow, so future efforts <br>
will be focusing on bringing up the speed. <br>
Wanted: I'd appreciate any info on some of the more obscure mappers. If you have any of this, <br>
please drop me a line at bradman@pobox.com<br>
