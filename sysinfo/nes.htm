Nintendo Entertainment System / Famicom (1985 USA)<br>
--------------------<br>
Bios = None required<br>
The Nintendo Entertainment System (called Famicom in<br>
Japan) was an instant hit with such popular titles as<br>
Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda and Excitebike.<br>
It was released to the states in August, 1985. The<br>
8-bit graphics were far superior to any-home based<br>
console that had come before it. Strong sales were<br>
were driven by the gamers wanting the feeling of<br>
real-life arcade games in their homes.  <br>
The NES boasts an impressive library of games with<br>
over 8000 games (Cowering goodnes), offering a<br>
smorgasbord of titles for fans of every genre.The<br>
Nintendo continued it's reign with other big hits such<br>
as The Mega Man series, Ninja Gaiden, Contra,<br>
Castlevania, Double Dragon and of course, Super Mario<br>
Bros 3. The NES continued it's strong sales with over<br>
36 million units sold worldwide by its official<br>
cancellation in January 1996 but not before releasing<br>
a remodeled NES. <br>
Usage<br>
--------------------<br>
Note that the one player hand controller Select is<br>
mapped as Coin 1 (default key 5), and <br>
Start is mapped as Player 1 Start (default key 1).<br>
This makes it convenient to use the driver with a<br>
"MAME" configured controller.<br>
Famicom Disk System switching is mapped to Player 1<br>
Button 3 (default key [space]).<br>

MESS Emulation State<br>
--------------------<br>
The NES driver should run most of the images currently<br>
out there with very little problem.  It doesn't yet<br>
support the obscure one-game mappers used by many<br>
"pirate carts".<br>
The NES driver has quite accurate sound and sample<br>
playback. For example, you can hear speech samples in<br>
Bayou Billy, Gauntlet, Dirty Harry, and Skate or Die<br>
that are not present in a few other NES emulators.<br>
The main focus up until this point has been in getting<br>
the NES driver as accurate as possible. <br>
Unfortunately, the scanline rendering method is quite<br>
slow, so future efforts will be focusing on bringing<br>
up the speed.<br>
Wanted: I'd appreciate any info on some of the more<br>
obscure mappers. If you have any of this, please drop<br>
me a line at bradman@pobox.com<br>
