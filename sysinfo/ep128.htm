<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The Enterprise 64 was a very long-awaited computer, two years between its announce and <br>
its marketing ! It changed its name a lot of times : its first name was Elan 64, then <br>
Flan, lastly Enterprise. It has great features, which wasn't found on all other home <br>
computers like its interfaces and its great graphics and sounds capacities provided by <br>
two special custom chips called "Nick" and "Dave". The Basic is supplied on a ROM <br>
cartridge and can be easily replaced with an other language. This basic is a very <br>
powerful structured basic with great graphic commands and can store several programs <br>
simultaneously in RAM. It has a small word processing in ROM and up to 32 computers can <br>
be linked together. Despite its great characteristics and all its interfaces, the <br>
Enterprise 64 had few success. Several months later, a new model was launched : the <br>
Enterprise 128 which is an Enterprise 64 with 128 KB RAM. <br>
