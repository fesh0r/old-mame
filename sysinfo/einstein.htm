<h4>Tatung Einstein TC-01</h4>
The Tatung Einstein is a 8-bit computer with hardware similar<br>
to the MSX-1. The computer was produced with two 3" disk drives and<br>
ran the CP/M operating system.<br>
The TC-01 is the first version of the hardware, with the 256 being<br>
the second version aimed more towards games.<br>
When this driver starts, and a disk is not in the drive, a internal<br>
monitor program will start. <br>
To use this driver you will need the Xtal operating system disks<br>
which will start CP/M and from here you can run many CP/M based<br>
programs.<br>
You can put a disk image into the drive and boot CP/M by pressing<br>
CTRL+ALT together.<br>
<p><b>Usage/Known Issues:</b><br>
The floppy disc emulation may not be fully working.<br>
Interrupts are not working properly.<br>
Thankyou to Chris Coxall for the schematics, a dump of the bios rom,<br>
and the Xtal operating system. He has been a great help with the development<br>
of this driver.<br>
Thankyou to Andrew Dunipace for help with the 80-column expansion card.<br>
