<h4>Commodore Amiga</h4>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b><br>
Sound is not currently supported.<br>
The driver is now working fairly well, though some games may need more memory than currently<br>
emulated.<br>
<p><b>History and Trivia:</b><br>
The conceptor of the Amiga 1000 was Jay Miner, who created the Atari 800 many years before. <br>
He wanted to make the most powerful computer ever, then he joined a little California <br>
company called Amiga. He used the principle of the three coprocessors (again) to help the <br>
main processor. At the beginning, the Amiga had only 64 kilobytes of RAM!, Atari wanted to <br>
buy the Amiga but finally, Commodore succeeded to buy it (then there was a lawsuit, which <br>
Commodore won). It was meant to be a competitor to the Atari 520 ST. The operating system <br>
was done by Metacomco, a British company who specialized in the 68000 processor (they also <br>
made languages for the Sinclair QL). It is a fully multitasking system which looks like <br>
UNIX with a graphical user interface. It was the very first personal computer with great <br>
graphics and sound capabilities with a GUI environment. The Amiga BASIC was written by <br>
Microsoft (like most other versions of BASIC). The Amiga 1000 began to lose popularity one <br>
year later with the creation of its two main successors: the Amiga 500 and the Amiga 2000.<br>
There were two versions of the Amiga 1000. The first one, just called "Amiga", was sold <br>
only in USA, had a NTSC display, and didn't have the video modes EHB and HAM, later <br>
versions would have this built in. The second one, called "Amiga 1000" (to avoid confusion <br>
with its successor, the Amiga 2000) had a PAL display, the enhanced video modes <br>
(HAM & EHB) and was built in Germany.<br>
