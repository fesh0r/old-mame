<p><b>Keyboard notes:</b><br>
The Tandy 1000 series computers have 12 function keys (analogous to modern PC keyboards) <br>
whose functions depend on the program you are running. <br>
Some function keys have special functions during boot up, if you press them right after the <br>
<p><b>startup "beep", while MS-DOS loads:</b><br>
* F1 = Switches the computer into monochrome video mode.<br>
* F2 = Switches the computer into composite/TV video mode (40 Column/200 scanline mode). <br>
This can also be achieved by issuing a MODE command from DOS.<br>
* F3 = Reverses the drive references so B: becomes the primary drive, <br>
and A: becomes the secondary drive, this lets you start the<br>
computer from the B Drive.<br>
* F4 = Starts the computer in slow (4 mhz) mode. <br>
This is useful if a program runs too fast or not at all in normal (8 mhz) mode.<br>
<p><b>Notes:</b><br>
get the setup utility for msdos at tandy's web side to change setup<br>
<p><b>MESS Emulation State:</b><br>
Basically the same as ibmpcjr<br>
Special setup memory emulated<br>
