<h4>Amstrad PCW8256/8512/9512/9512+/10</h4>
----------------------------------<br>
These machines were designed primiarly for wordprocessing (hence the name<br>
"Personal Computer Wordprocessor"), but are capable of a lot more.<br>
The original PCW8256 system had a green screen monitor, with 2 3" disc<br>
drives mounted vertically in it, a keyboard and a special printer. (The CPU and other <br>
hardware was also contained in the base of the monitor)<br>
Later models changed the case design, but also allowed the use of any printer that <br>
was available. (The original 8256 had a proprietry printer and interface).<br>
The hardware is simple, a Z80 running at 4Mhz, slowed to 3.3 with wait states, an Amstrad <br>
ASIC custom chip for driving the display (2 colours, 720x256 in PAL, 720x200 in NTSC), a <br>
beep for sound, and a NEC765 floppy disc controller.<br>
The boot-program is contained on the printer chip, and is enabled at power-on or reset. <br>
The data is passed through a Amstrad custom ASIC chip, and is executed by the Z80. The <br>
program is simple, and just loads track 0, side 0,sector &01 to &f000 where it is then <br>
executed at &f010. (The first 16 bytes appear to contain some format parameters which <br>
are used to initialise CPM). I don't own a PCW machine so I don't know the exact display <br>
that the PCW shows on boot-up.<br>
AFAIK, no dumps are available for this program. The MESS driver uses a program coded by <br>
myself. This program waits for a key to be pressed and then starts the boot procedure. If <br>
an error occurs, the screen will flash 6 times, and then it will repeat the procedure. If <br>
all is well, you will see some lines appear on the screen, and the boot will continue.<br>
The original computer came with CP/M and Locoscript (a special wordprocessor).<br>
Since it was able to use CP/M there was a lot of public domain and CP/M programs available <br>
that would run on it.<br>
A few games were written for it, two of these are "Head Over Heels" and "Hitchhikers Guide <br>
to the Galaxy".<br>
THIS SYSTEM REQUIRES A BOOT DISK TO RUN!<br>
