The Adventure Vision was a cartridge based, electronic handheld video game that was <br>
manufactured by Entex Industries in 1982. It measured about 13 1/4" X 10" X 9" and used <br>
one vertical strip of 40 red LEDs and a spinning mirror to produce a screen with a 150X40 <br>
resolution drawn at 15 frames/sec. There were only four cartridges produced for it: Defender, <br>
Turtles, Super Cobra, and an Asteroids clone, Space Force.<br>
