Imgtool - A generic image manipulation tool for MESS

Imgtool is a tool for the maintenance and manipulation of disk and other types
of images that MESS users need to deal with.  Functions include retrieving and
storing files and CRC checking/validation.

Imgtool is part of the MESS project.  It shares large portions of code with
MESS/MAME, and its existance would not be if it were not for MESS.  As such,
the distribution terms are the same as MESS.  Please read mess.txt thouroughly.

Using Imgtool
=============

Imgtool is a command line program that contains several "subcommands" that
actually do all of the work.  Most commands are invoked in a manner along the
lines of this:

	imgtool <subcommand> <format> <image> ...

<subcommand> is the name of the subcommand
<format> is the format of the image
<image> is the filename of the image

Further details vary with each subcommand.  Also note that not all subcommands
are applicable or supported for different image formats.

Certain Imgtool subcommands (info, crc, good) make use of the CRC files, so if
you use these commands, make sure that your CRC directory is set up.
