commodore c65
-------------

homecomputer under the keyboard to redo the commodore c64
success (with good c64 compatibility)

Never released, because the compatibility was not good enough!
(Some prototypes! were sold)

Project name was C64DX

Features
--------
hardware emulation mode for c64
 adapter needed for c64 cartridges (many should work)
 only standard c64 keys plus cursor-up and cursor-left
 cpu not full compatible (no illegal instructions)
enhanced keyboard
m65ce02 processor core (1 or 3.5 Mhz frequency)
vic3 (4567) with additional capabilities
 vic2 compatibility mode
 graphic modes
 80 column modes
second sid audio chip (both 8580)
uart 6511 rs232 chip
special dma controller
128 kb ram
128 kb rom (kernel, editor, basic, monitor, characters, c64 roms)
build in mfm floppy disk 3 1/2 inch double sided double density
connector for second mem floppy disk
special ram expansion slot
rs232 connector (round din)
no tape connector
new expansion slot


MESS emulation state
--------------------
rasterline based video system
 quick modified vic6567/c64 video chip
 no support for enhanced features, only 80 column mode
 no cpu holding
 imperfect scrolling support (when 40 columns or 25 lines)
 lightpen support not finished
 rasterline not finished
no sound
cia6526's look in machine/cia6526.c
keyboard
gameport a
 paddles 1,2
 joystick 1
 2 button joystick/mouse joystick emulation
 no mouse
 lightpen (not finished)
gameport b
 paddles 3,4
 joystick 2
 2 button joystick/mouse joystick emulation
 no mouse
serial bus
 simple disk drives (device 10 and 11, hang in c64 mode!)
 no printer or other devices
expansion modules
 none (did there any exist)
expansion modules c64 (adapter needed)
 ultimax rom cartridges not working
 rom cartridges (exrom) not working
 no other rom cartridges (bankswitching logic in it, switching exrom, game)
 no ieee488 support
 no cpm cartridge
 no speech cartridge (no circuit diagram found)
 no fm sound cartridge
 no other expansion modules
no userport
 no rs232/v.24 interface


Keys
----
Some PC-Keyboards does not behave well when special two or more keys are
pressed at the same time
(with my keyboard printscreen clears the pressed pause key!)

shift-cbm switches between upper-only and normal character set
(when wrong characters on screen this can help)
run (shift-stop) loads pogram from type and starts it


Lightpen
--------
Paddle 5 x-axe
Paddle 6 y-axe


Discs
-----
only file load from drive 10 and 11 implemented
 loads file from rom directory (*.prg,*.p00) (must NOT be specified on commandline
 or file from d64 image (here also directory LOAD"$",8 supported)
use LOAD"filename",10
or LOAD"filename",10,1 (for loading machine language programs at their address)
for loading
type RUN or the appropriate sys call to start them

several programs rely on more features
(loading other file types, writing, ...)

most games rely on starting own programs in the floppy drive
(and therefor cpu level emulation is needed)


Quickloader
-----------
.prg and .p00 files supported
loads program into memory and sets program end pointer
(works with most programs)
program ready to get started with RUN
loads first rom when you press quickload key (numeric slash)

when problems start with -log and look into error.log file
