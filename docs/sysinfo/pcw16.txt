Amstrad PCW16
-------------

The Amstrad PCW16 was designed for the same reason as the Amstrad PCW.
This system has been greatly enhanced with a faster CPU, enhanced graphics
resolution and colours, and a really nice user interface.

The PCW16 has a high-density floppy disc drive which uses the MSDOS filesystem.

The computer has 2mb of flash file memory which is used to store documents
and user details.

The PCW16 uses a Super I/O chip which is found in many modern PC's and this
provides serial, parallel, floppy disc drive, hard drive and joystick functions.

Mess Emulation State
--------------------

All major functions are working and the computer is useable, however there
are some accuracy problems.


a. SCREEN DISPLAY
-----------------

The screen emulation does not support mid-frame or mid-line changes.
I don't think any programs do this yet?


b. PRINTER
----------

Not working. The printer emulation assumes a ECP/EPP compatible parallel port
which is not yet emulated. Therefore you cannot print out documents :(

c. HARD DRIVE
-------------

Not emulated. Has anyone used a hard-drive on their PCW16? Please let me know
and I will add support for it.

d. ANALOGUE JOYSTICKS
---------------------

Not emulated. Are there any programs which use the joysticks?


Notes
-----

To use the PCW16 you will need the OS rescue disc, when this has been inserted,
and the on/off switch has been toggled (see UI for the dipswitch to do this),
then the OS will be installed.
When the OS is installed the computer is now useable and you can write documents
and perform tasks.

The emulation will run the CP/M implementation by John Elliot. It should run
almost all software provided it is in a disc image.

Development has been halted because this computer is in a working state.
I plan to go back to it to fix the remaining problems at a later date when I
have more time and more information.

If you want to see more added to this driver, please contact me and I will
try and fix it.
