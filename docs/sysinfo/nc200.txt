Amstrad NC200 Notebook computer
-------------------------------

The Amstrad NC200 Notebook computer is a portable computer.

This system has a fold-down LCD screen, nice keyboard and disc drive.
(The disc format is 720k PC Double Density DOS compatible).

The memory is  protected by a lithium battery which is charged when the computer
is connected to a mains supply.

PCMCIA ram cards can be used to store programs and documents.

The computer has a built in wordprocessor, BBC Basic, Serial Terminal,
Calculator, Diary and more. The whole system is a personal organiser with lots
of extras.

Mess Emulation State
--------------------

a. ACCURACY
-----------

The emulation is reasonably accurate. There are no documents about the hardware
of the NC200. Originally Cliff Lawson published details but these have been lost
when his WWW site went down. Since then he has been unable to write up the details
of the hardware (Cliff is a very busy man).

So I have worked out much of the NC200 hardware by dissassembling the ROM and I have
also had much help from Russel Marks.

a. PRINTER
----------

Same state as NC100, please see nc.txt for details.

b. PCMCIA RAM CARD
------------------

Same state as NC100, please see nc.txt for details.

c. SERIAL
---------

Serial is not working properly. It is almost at the same state as the NC100.

d. DISK DRIVE
-------------

Not working. I am trying to find out the details of the disc interface by looking
at lots of dissassemblys!
