Keyboard notes
--------------
The Tandy 1000 series computers have 12 function keys (analogous to modern PC keyboards) 
whose functions depend on the program you are running. 
Some function keys have special functions during boot up, if you press them right after the 
startup "beep", while MS-DOS loads:
* F1 = Switches the computer into monochrome video mode.
* F2 = Switches the computer into composite/TV video mode (40 Column/200 scanline mode). 
This can also be achieved by issuing a MODE command from DOS.
* F3 = Reverses the drive references so B: becomes the primary drive, 
and A: becomes the secondary drive, this lets you start the
computer from the B Drive.
* F4 = Starts the computer in slow (4 mhz) mode. 
This is useful if a program runs too fast or not at all in normal (8 mhz) mode.
