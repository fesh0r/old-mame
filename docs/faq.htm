<div class="level3">

<p>

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is an acronym that stands for Multi Emulator Super System. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> will more or less faithfully reproduce computer and console systems on a PC. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> can currently emulate over 250 systems from the last 5 decades.
</p>

<p>
<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> emulates the
 hardware of the systems and sometimes utilizes ROM images to load 
programs and games. Therefore, these systems are NOT simulations, but 
the actual emulations of the hardware.

<div class="level3">

<p>

The primary purpose of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is to preserve decades of computer and console history. As technology continues to rush forward, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> prevents these important “vintage” systems from being lost and forgotten. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is based on <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>.

<h3><a name="what_is_an_emulator_and_a_simulator" id="what_is_an_emulator_and_a_simulator">What is an emulator and a simulator?</a></h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>

An emulator attempts to recreate the original functions of the hardware.
 Software run on an emulator should perform exactly as if it were being 
run on the original hardware. This may include bugs or flaws that were 
on the original system.
</p>

<p>
A simulator attempts to recreate the original functions of the software,
 essentially imitating the game or software. The end results may look 
very similar between emulation and simulation but they are very 
different in how they are implemented.
</p>

<p>
<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> and <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> are both emulators. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> emulates computer, console and hand held systems, and <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> emulates arcade games.

<p>

The primary objective of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 is to accurately emulate multiple systems. Most stand alone 
emulators/simulators often focus on letting you play games on your PC. 
They often include speed hacks or fudge things to make them look right. 
The philosophy of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 is to behave exactly like the original hardware, even if it is slower, 
so that all software for the original machine will work as it would on 
the original hardware. The focus on accuracy tends to make <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> a bit slower than other emulators, but this is not always true.

No. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is based on the <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> core. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> provides additional drivers and tools to emulate different systems. <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> is for arcade machines, and <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is for home computers and video game consoles.

It is could be possible in the future but right now each is targeting a set of systems to emulate. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is built on top of the <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>
 infrastructure and they share many of the same CPU code. The teams work
 very close and many developers contribute to both projects. Many arcade
 systems emulated in <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> are based on or related to consoles emulated in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>. There is a mutual benefit in testing and development of these related drivers.

<div class="level3">

<p>

In general a PC with a decent processor should run most of the systems 
at a decent speed. There are an enormous variety of systems emulated and
 each system has its own requirements. The best thing to do is try the 
system you are interested in. But remember accuracy is the primary goal 
not speed.

<div class="level3">

<p>

First, it is important to note that in the emulation world, the term ROM is used to refer to two different things:

</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The ROM chips within a computer system, that usually contain some form of BASIC or the like</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The ROM chips within a game cartridge for a console system</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

In <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, #1 are 
also termed as “BIOS”, after what they are typically called in Intel PC 
systems. The term “cartridge image” is used to refer to #2, where 
“image” is a generic term that applies to downloaded images of removable
 media, whether they be a cartridge, a floppy drive, or a hard disk.
</p>

</div>
<!-- SECTION "What is a BIOS?/What's a ROM?/What is a disk image?" [5020-5654] -->
<h3><a name="where_do_i_get_bioses_roms_how_do_i_use_my_old_software_with_mess" id="where_do_i_get_bioses_roms_how_do_i_use_my_old_software_with_mess">Where do I get BIOSes/ROMs?/How do I use my old software with MESS?</a></h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>

In most cases, old software is physically incompatible with modern 
computers. No matter how hard you push, an Atari cartridge just plain 
won't fit in your computer's floppy drive. Folding up old 5¼” diskettes 
so they fit in a 3½” drive will only break your disks. Obviously there 
is a problem here - how do I get that software into my PC so an emulator
 can use it?
</p>

<p>
It is possible to build special cartridge reading devices for console 
systems and hook up old computers to new ones to transfer floppy disks. 
These media get transferred into files on the new computer.
</p>

<p>
Now, originally emulation was just for hobbyists who had all this 
special equipment, but some of them put these BIOSes and images up on 
the Internet for people to download, on the honor system that people 
would only download the BIOSes and images that they owned the original 
software for. Unfortunately, a lot of people came along who just wanted 
to download free games and did not care about preservation, and gave the
 emulation community a bad name among software companies. There are many
 BIOSes/images sites on the Internet, using a search engine should turn 
up the ones you want. But remember: Downloading pirated BIOSes/images 
that you do not own is illegal. Some people say that the copyrights have
 expired or that you can download it if you delete it after 24 hours, 
but they are wrong. It is up to you whether you want to ignore the law, 
as most of the games are not and will not ever be sold again.
</p>

<p>
Most systems require BIOSes. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is very picky about its BIOSes - they must be exactly the ones it is expecting, otherwise it may not work.

<div class="level3">

<p>

BIOSes should go, still zipped, in the <code>roms</code> subfolder of wherever you put <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> (create it if it doesn't exist). Game images can go anywhere, although by default the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> will look in the <code>software\[system name]</code> subfolder of your <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> folder. They can still be zipped, but for command-line <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> there can only be one image per zip file (MESSUI supports multiple images per zip file).

<div class="level3">

<p>

For the command line version, type ”<code>mess [system] [device] [game] [options]</code>”, where <code>[system]</code> is the system driver name, <code>[device]</code> is the type of ROM, <code>[game]</code> is the filename of the ROM, and options are command line options. Valid <code>[device]</code> names (eg <code>-cart</code> and <code>-flop</code>) can be found by using <code>mess -listmedia</code>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Example:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="code">mess nes -cart C:\ROMs\NES\zelda.nes -nosound</pre>

<p>

This will run the Zelda game on the Nintendo system without sound.

<div class="level3">

<p>

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>' goal is 
compatibility over speed. Some computers might not be able to provide 
the needed power for full speed emulation. Many other emulators perform 
shortcuts that sacrifice compatibility in favor of performance, which is
 a valid tradeoff given a different set of design goals. With <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>,
 your CPU is doing the jobs of the CPU(s), graphics chip(s), sound 
chip(s), as well as any other special hardware present in the original 
machine, so it can be bogged down fairly easily, especially by the 
relatively unoptimized <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> core. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 is written almost entirely in C, not assembly, for compatibility and 
portability reasons. Additionally, there is a level of overhead required
 to get the level of modularity that it takes to have the myriad 
components in the emulation be usable across a broad set of drivers.

First you need to make a clean compile of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> with symbols turned on, you can find the info on the <a href="http://mess.redump.net/compiling_mess" class="wikilink1" title="compiling_mess">Compiling MESS</a> page. If you used the <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>
 MinGW build tools you should already have a copy of GDB, if not 
download GDB and install it into your MinGW directory. Open up the 
command promt and type <code>gdb mess</code> then run <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> inside GDB as you would the command prompt <code>run nes -cart C:\software\NES\metroid.nes -window</code> for example. Run the emulation until you encounter the crash you need to backtrace. It should pause instead of crashing out <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, look at the GDB window and there will be a sigsev or error message, type <code>bt</code> to get a full backtrace.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally GDB will pause the emulation at an error which isn't the

If you have programming skills, you can download the source and fix 
bugs, improve emulation on existing systems or add a new one! If you fix
 anything, be sure to submit the fixes so they can be included in the 
source. Be advised that corrections or additions may not be accepted if 
they are hackish in nature; <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 strives for accuracy both in emulation and in the source code. Another 
major concern is the verifiability of the changes. One major obstacle in
 <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> that often the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> maintainer may understand the system much less than you do, and it can be very difficult for the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> maintainer to validate any changes, so changes submitted to <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 should be accompanied with instructions on how to run the system and 
how to run specific software that failed to run before, but runs after 
the changes. It generally does not suffice to simply say “Look at page 
XYZ.  It provides complete information on how to run the WowieZowie 
system”. The <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
  developers need to know the specifics, and cannot run around how to 
use a very obscure system just to save the time of a submitter.
</p>

<p>
As an alternative, one way to contribute is to modernize drivers. Over <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>'s/<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>'s
 lifetime, there have been core improvements for which not all drivers 
have been modified to take advantage. These techniques include:

If you do not have programming skills, you can help by documenting emulated systems and software, adding <acronym title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</acronym>
 entries, reporting bugs, submitting artwork and so on – anything to 
assist those with programming skills and improve the project.

If you are comfortable programming C, you can download the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> source code and attempt to fix it yourself. If you have questions about the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> source, ask them on the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> message board.
</p>

<p>
If you are not comfortable programming C, the best thing for you to do is to create a bug report at <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 Bugzilla. When reporting a bug, make sure to include as much 
information as possible, including snapshots, links, descriptions, and 
instructions. Keep in mind that <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 emulates hundreds of systems and the reader may not be familiar with 
the system or driver you are reporting a bug in. A bug report with 
simple, clear instructions and a reproducible case is much more likely 
to get fixed. Also, if you know a previous version of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> that worked correctly please include that information.
