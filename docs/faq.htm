		<h2>MESS FAQ?</h2>
		<p>This FAQ was written to support <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>. If you 
			have any changes, suggestions or additions please contact the <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A> team. Changes will be made as time is available. If you have a 
			question that is not answered in this FAQ, try the searching the <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A> message boards. There is a wealth of information there already.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g01">What is MESS?</h2>
		<p><A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> is an acronym that stands for Multiple 
			Emulator Super System. <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> will more or 
			less faithfully reproduce computer and console systems on a PC. <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A> can currently emulate over 250 systems from the last 5 decades.
		</p>
		<p><A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> emulates the hardware of the systems and 
			sometimes utilizes ROM images to load programs and games. Therefore, these 
			systems are NOT simulations, but the actual emulations of the hardware.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g02">What is the purpose of MESS?</h2>
		<p>The primary purpose of <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> is to preserve 
			decades of computer and console history. As technology continues to rush 
			forward, <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> prevents these important 
			"vintage" systems from being lost and forgotten. <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>
			is based on <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A> . Additional information 
			about <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> or <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a>
			can be found at <a href="http://www.mess.org/">www.mess.org</a> or <a href="http://www.mame.net/">
				www.mame.net</a>.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g03">What is an emulator and a simulator?</h2>
		<p>An <i>emulator</i> attempts to recreate the original functions of the hardware. 
			Software run on a emulator should perform exactly as if it were being run on 
			the original hardware.
		</p>
		<p>A <i>simulator</i> attempts to recreate the original functions of the software, 
			essentially imitating the game or software. The end results may look very 
			similar between emulation and simulation but they are very different in how 
			they are implemented.
		</p>
		<p><A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> and <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A>
			are both emulators. <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> emulates computer 
			and console systems, and <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A> emulates 
			arcade games. This may include bugs or flaws that were on the original system.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g04">What makes MESS different from other emulators?</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>
				emulates many types of systems (console, computer, handheld, calculator 
				etc...), not just one like some other emulators.
				<li>
					<A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>
				is free.
				<li>
					<A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>
				is open source so anyone who knows the C programming language can help improve 
				the project.
				<li>
					The architecture of <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>
				makes it easy to add lesser known systems.
				<LI>
					<A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> strives for accuracy and portability 
					above all else.</LI>
			</ul>
			The primary objective of <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> is to 
			accurately emulate multiple systems. Most stand alone emulators/simulators 
			often focus on letting you play games on your PC. They often include speed 
			hacks or fudge things to make them <i>look</i> right. The philosophy of <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A> is to behave <u>exactly</u> like the original hardware, even if it 
			is slower, so that <u>all</u> software for the original machine will work as it 
			would on the original hardware. This tends to make <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>
			a bit slower than other emulators, but this is not always true.
			<h2 id="g05">Is MESS really free?</h2>
		<p>Yes, <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> is really free. The source code is 
			freely available, too. It is illegal to sell <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>
			or its source.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g06">Isn't MESS the same as MAME?</h2>
		<p>No. <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> is based on <A href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</A>, and uses the same underlying engine, but its goals are different. 
			To put it simply, <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A> is for arcade 
			machines, and <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> is for home computers and 
			video game consoles.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g07">Why don't MESS and MAME merge?</h2>
		<p>Although the people involved in developing new versions of both programs are 
			enthusiasts working out of love for the systems involved, the systems are 
			essentially different. Arcade games, which <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a>
			specializes in, are usually unique, in that the hardware for any particular 
			game was a one-time solution arrived at in order to get the game to market. 
			Some game companies, such as SNK, <a href="http://www.nintendo.com">Nintendo</a>
			and others, did develop systems that could be changed over to play other games 
			relatively easily, but this wasn't the rule in the arcades. To emulate an 
			arcade game, the programmer develops a driver file which mimics hardware 
			surrounding the arcade game's CPU or CPUs. Both <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A>
			and <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> contain the same cores to emulate 
			the same CPUs. The focus of <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> is accurate 
			emulation of the hardware of computer and gaming consoles, hardware which 
			doesn't change depending <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> on which game 
			or program is being run. Fundamentally, <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A> 
			and <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> are being created by and are 
			targeted for slightly different segments of the emulation community: gamers and 
			vintage computer enthusiasts. Those two communities do often times overlap, and 
			a merger of the two programs is theoretically possible at some point in the 
			future.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g08">Why doesn't MESS split into two versions, one for consoles and one for 
			computers?</h2>
		<p>Why isn't there a program called MASS to mimic mainframes? So far it hasn't 
			seemed necessary to split <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> ; into two 
			programs. The core program inherited on a regular basis from new updates of <A href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</A>; can accommodate a large number of systems. If you think of each 
			arcade game in <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A> as a separate computer 
			or console, the latest version has over 3,000 different machines available, 
			compared to <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>' hundreds of systems listed 
			under its All Systems menu. The border dividing gaming consoles from computers 
			tends to blur the further back you go in time. Is Nippon Electric Company's PC 
			Engine a game system or a computer? Coleco originally marketed its Adam 
			computer as an add-on to the Colecovision gaming system. <a href="http://www.nintendo.com">
				Nintendo</a> also had big plans to turn its NES and later SNES into 
			full-fledged computers delivering information and services to users over an 
			early version of the internet. The APF Imagination Machine was also built 
			around a game console core. Atari's computers grew from its original gaming 
			consoles, and were probably used more for gaming in their day than any serious 
			computing projects. The simple answer is there is still a lot of room for <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A> to include new gaming consoles and computers. The complicated 
			answer is that it is hard to tell the difference.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g09">I still do not understand why MAME and MESS will not merge. Since 
					the cores are kept so close together, shouldn't #ifdef's suffice?</h2>
		<p>
			Yes, to a point. In a sense, #ifdefs do suffice and all of <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A>'s overrides to the core are encapsulated in #ifdefs. In theory, <A href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</A> and <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> could be developed out 
			of a common source tree similar to how Xmame and Xmess are maintained in a 
			unified fashion. But there are additional considerations. Unlike Xmame and 
			Xmess, <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A> and <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>
			are maintained by different groups. In the course of <A href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</A> development, occasionally sweeping changes are made that require 
			small changes to every <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A> driver. If <A href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</A> and <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> were maintained out of 
			the same source tree, then the <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A> people 
			would be responsible for keeping MESS up to date as well during such changes. 
			Conversely, changes to <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> would need to be 
			scrutinized for breakage in <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of these issues, it is more prudent to keep two separate source trees. 
			When breaking changes occur in <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A>, the <A href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</A> people can then update all of the <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A>
			drivers and when that is done and the changes are released, the <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A> people can do the same process on the various <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A> drivers.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g10">How come my emails to the MESS developers do not receive replies?</h2>
		<p>The <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> developers receive a large volume of 
			email, and also suffer from "Real life syndrome", and thus might not be able to 
			reply, particularly when such questions are answered in this FAQ. Your best bet 
			is to ask a question on the <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> message 
			board at <A href="http://www.mess.org/">http://www.mess.org/</A></p>
		<h2 id="s01">What do I need to run MESS?</h2>
		<p>In general a PC with a decent processor should run most of the systems at a 
			decent speed. There are an enormous variety of systems emulated and each system 
			has its own requirements. The best thing to do is try the system you are 
			interested in. But remember accuracy is the primary goal not speed.
		</p>
		<h2 id="s02">What is a BIOS?/What's a ROM?/What is a disk image?</h2>
		<p>First, it is important to note that in the emulation world, the term ROM is used 
			to refer to two different things:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			The ROM chips within a computer system, that usually contain some form of BASIC 
			or the like
			<li>
				The ROM chips within a game cartridge for a console system
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>For the sake of clarity, the official <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> terminology 
			for #1 is "BIOS", after what they are typically called in Intel PC systems, and 
			the term "ROM" is avoided. The term "cartridge image" is used to refer to #2, 
			where "image" is a generic term that applies to downloaded images of removable 
			media, whether they be a cartridge, a floppy drive, or a hard disk.
		</p>
		<h2 id="s03">Where do I get BIOSes/ROMs?/How do I use my old software with MESS?</h2>
		<p>In most cases, old software is physically incompatible with modern computers. No 
			matter how hard you push, an Atari cartridge just plain won't fit in your 
			computer's floppy drive. Folding up old 5 1/4" diskettes so they fit in a 3 
			1/2" drive will only break your disks. Obviously there is a problem here - how 
			do I get that software into my PC so an emulator can use it?
		</p>
		<p>It is possible to build special cartridge reading devices for console systems 
			and hook up old computers to new ones to transfer floppy disks. These media get 
			transferred into files on the new computer.
		</p>
		<p>Now, originally emulation was just for hobbyists who had all this special 
			equipment, but some of them put these BIOSes and images up on the Internet for 
			people to download, on the honor system that people would only download the 
			BIOSes and images that they owned the original software for. Unfortunately, a 
			lot of people came along who just wanted to download free games and did not 
			care about preservation, and gave the emulation community a bad name among 
			software companies. There are many BIOSes/images sites on the Internet, using a 
			search engine should turn up the ones you want. But remember: downloading 
			pirated BIOSes/images that you do not own is illegal. Some people say that the 
			copyrights have expired or that you can download it if you delete it after 24 
			hours, but they are wrong. It is up to you whether you want to ignore the law, 
			as most of the games are not and will not ever be sold again.
		</p>
		<p>Most systems require BIOSes. <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> is very 
			picky about its BIOSes -- they must be exactly the ones it is expecting, 
			otherwise it may not work.
		</p>
		<h2 id="s04">Okay, I got some BIOSes and images, now where do I put them?
			<P></P>
		</h2>
		<p>BIOSes should go, still zipped, in the BIOS subfolder of wherever you put <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A>. Game images should go into the SOFTWARE\[system name] folder. 
			They can still be zipped, but only one image per zip file.
		</p>
		<h2 id="s05">How do I start the MESS application?</h2>
		<p>For DOS, type "mess [system] [device] [game] [options]", where [system] is the 
			system driver name, [device] is the type of ROM, [game] is the filename of the 
			ROM, and options are command line options. Valid [device] names (eg -cart and 
			-flop) can be found by using "mess -listdevices" and valid options are listed 
			in the mess.txt and msdos.txt files.
		</p>
		<p>For example:
			<br>
			mess nes -cart zelda.nes -nosound (This will run the Zelda game on the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com">
				Nintendo</a> system without sound. See mess.txt for more examples.
		</p>
		<p>For UNIX/Linux, do the same thing except the name of the program is xmess.
		</p>
		<p>For Macintosh or Windows OS, run the MacMESS or messgui.exe application and 
			click on the system or software you want to run.
		</p>
		<h2 id="s06">I did everything just like you said, but it still does not work!
			<P></P>
		</h2>
		<p>There is a message board you can go to for help at <a href="http://www.mess.org/">http://www.mess.org</a>. 
			But first, make sure you read this FAQ and the rest of the documentation. The 
			answers can often be found there. Also check out the <a href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</a> FAQ at <a href="http://www.mame.net/">http://www.mame.net</a> --it 
			is a very good resource for things common to <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a>
			and <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>, such as sound and graphics setup. 
			Also search through the message board to see if somebody already had the same 
			problem. And at least put some effort into fixing it yourself. People on 
			message boards can get very annoyed with people who ask questions that have 
			already been answered elsewhere, especially in readme.txt and mess.txt.
		</p>
		<h2 id="s07">It works, but it is way too slow!</h2>
		<p>Because of <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>' goal of compatibility over 
			speed, this is often the case. You might think that your computer should be 
			able to emulate such old machines at full speed, but keep in mind that <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a> is not performing any shortcuts in the emulation such as those 
			performed by HLE emulators. Many other emulators perform shortcuts that 
			sacrifice compatibility in favor of performance, which is a valid tradeoff 
			given a different set of design goals. With <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>, 
			your CPU is doing the jobs of the CPU(s), graphics chip(s), sound chip(s), as 
			well as any other special hardware present in the original machine, so it can 
			be bogged down fairly easily, especially by the relatively unoptimized <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a> core. <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> is written almost 
			entirely in C, not assembly, for compatibility and portability reasons. 
			Additionally, there is a level of overhead required to get the level of 
			modularity that it takes to have the myriad components in the emulation be 
			usable across a broad set of drivers. There are some tweaks you can do to speed 
			up the performance a bit (see the <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a> FAQ), 
			but if you need a big boost, there is not much you can do except buy a faster 
			computer, wait for an update (not likely), or use another emulator.
		</p>
		<h2 id="s08">For some reason, ESC does not quit MESS nor does TAB bring up the 
			menu!</h2>
		<p>In <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> for Win32, there are two UIs use at 
			runtime. There is the "Classic UI" which is derived from <A href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</A>'s UI, and there is the "New UI" which uses a standard Windows 
			menu bar to operate the emulation. By default, the New UI is enabled. However, 
			some people prefer to use the older UI. This can be done in one of two ways.</p>
		<OL>
			<LI>
				When running the <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>
			GUI (messgui.exe), choose "Options --&gt; Default System Options --&gt; 
			Miscellaneous Tab" and uncheck the "Use New UI" checkbox.
			<LI>
				If it exists, edit mess.ini and change the "newui" setting to "0". For more 
				details on mess.ini, consult <a href="windows/win32cmd.htm">Using MESS at the 
					Command Line</a>
			</LI>
		</OL>
		<h2 id="h01">How do I set up the screenshots/snapshots folder for MESS?</h2>
		<p>The snapshot (aka screenshot) folder is the place to store images to be 
			displayed in the GUI. It can display in-game/software images and system images, 
			or anything else as long as it is named correctly.
		</p>
		<p>The snapshot folder can be configured in the Directories... window under the 
			Options menu in the GUI. The default screen folder is snap. Store system images 
			with the system name. Store software/game snapshots in a folder under the 
			system they belong to.
		</p>
		<p>For example:
			<br>
			mess/snap/a2600.png &lt;&lt;&lt; This is a picture of an Atari system. The name 
			needs to match the driver.<br>
			mess/snap/a2600/junglehunt.png &lt;&lt;&lt; This is an in-game screenshot of 
			the game Jungle Hunt. The name needs to match game name.
		</p>
		<h2 id="h02">How do get screenshots?</h2>
		<p>You can take your own screen shots by selecting the 'Save Screenshot' option in 
			the file menu while in emulation. This will save an image in the png format 
			with the name of the driver (if one does not exist already). If an image 
			already exists an a sequential number will be added to the name (for example 
			coco.png, coco0000.png, coco0001.png etc...).
		</p>
		<p>You can also find many images on various emulation or download images from the 
			internet at various sites. Try your favorite search engine.
		</p>
		<h2 id="h03">How do I compile/build/debug MESS for Windows?</h2>
		<p>For Windows, see the <A href="windows/compile.htm">How to compile MESS (Win32)</A>
			document. Compiling <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> for Windows 
			requires the <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a> toolkit, a variant of <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">
				GCC</a>. <A href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</A> comes with a variant of 
			GDB for debugging.</p>
		<h2 id="h04">How do I compile/build/debug MESS with Visual C?</h2>
		<p>On the <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> download site, there are Visual C 
			project files but they are extremely outdated. In theory, one could grab the <a href="http://www.vcmame.net/">
				VCMame</a> project files and port them over to build <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A>, but to my knowledge no one has done this yet.</p>
		<P>There is also an alternative makefile (makefile.vc) that uses the Visual C 
			command line compilers but the makefile itself requires <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">
				GNU make</a> rather than nmake. Using the Microsoft compilers allows one to 
			use the Visual C debugger to debug <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>, but 
			one does not get the full benefits of the IDE.</P>
		<h2 id="h05">How do I compile/build/debug MESS for Un*x?</h2>
		<p>See <a href="http://x.mame.net/">http://x.mame.net/</a>.</p>
		<h2 id="h06">How do I contribute to the MESS project?</h2>
		<p>If you have programming skills, you can download the source and fix bugs, 
			improve emulation on existing systems or add a new one! If you fix anything, be 
			sure to submit the fixes so they can be included in the source. Be advised that 
			corrections or additions may not be accepted if they are hackish in nature; <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A> strives for accuracy both in emulation and in the source code. 
			Another major concern is the verifiability of the changes. One major obstacle 
			in <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> that often the <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A> maintainer may understand the system much less than you do, and it 
			can be very difficult for the <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> maintainer 
			to validate any changes, so changes submitted to&nbsp;<A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>&nbsp;<STRONG>should 
				be accompanied with instructions on how to run the system and how to run 
				specific software that failed to run before, but runs after the changes</STRONG>.&nbsp;It 
			generally does not suffice to simply say "Look at page XYZ.&nbsp; It provides 
			complete information on how to run the WowieZowie system." The <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A> &nbsp;developers need to know the specifics, and cannot&nbsp;run 
			around&nbsp;how to use a very obscure system just to save the time&nbsp;of a 
			submitter.</p>
		<p>
			As an alternative, one way to contribute is to modernize drivers. Over <a href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</a>'s/<a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS<a>'s lifetime, there have been core 
					improvements for which not all drivers have been modified to take advantage. 
					These techniques include:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Unified read/write address maps</li>
						<li>
							Natural keyboard support</li>
						<li>

					For details on what these mean, it is probably best to ask about them on the <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
						MESS</A> message board.

				<P>If you do not have programming skills, you can help by documenting emulated 
			systems and software, adding FAQ entries, reporting bugs, submitting artwork 
			and so on - anything to assist those with programming skills and improve the 
			project.

		<h2 id="t01">I have found a bug; what can I do to help the MESS developers fix it?</h2>
		<p>If you are comfortable programming C, you can download the <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A> source code and attempt to fix it yourself. If you have questions 
			about the <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> source, you can ask them on 
			the <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A> message board.
		</p>
		<P>If you are not comfortable programming C, the best thing for you to do is to 
			create a reproducible case and report it at <a href="http://bugzilla.mess.org">MESS 
				Bugzilla</a>. When reporting a bug, be sure to keep in mind that <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A> is a multiple emulation system, and the reader of your bug report 
			might not be intimately familiar with the system that you are using. In other 
			words, if you find a bug in the WowieZowie driver, do not expect the reader of 
			the bug report to know the command for loading a file on WowieZowieOS. If a bug 
			report contains a concrete reproducible case that is understandable even to 
			someone not familiar with that system, it is much more likely to be fixed. 
			Alternatively, if a bug was not present in an earlier <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A> version, it helps greatly to identify which <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</A> version introduced the bug.</P>

		<p>
			If you ask for help on the message board, post it in both English and your 
			native language. Many people there speak more than one language and may be able 
			to help you in your native language. Also, visit <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com">
				http://babelfish.altavista.com</a>. They have a translation program that 
			can translate between English and most European languages as well as a number 
			of other languages. Also look at the <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A> FAQ 
			at <a href="http://www.mame.net">http://www.mame.net</a>. It is in many 
			different languages, including Greek, Serbian, Romanian, Norwegian, Danish, 
			Hebrew, Czech, Dutch, French, Italian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, German, 
			Portuguese, Spanish and Finnish.
