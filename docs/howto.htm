<div class="level2">

<p>

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is an acronym which stands for Multi Emulator Super System. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 documents and reproduces through emulation the inner components of 
computers, consoles, chess computers and calculators. As a nice 
side-effect, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> allows to use on a modern PC those programs and games which were originally developed for the emulated machines. 
</p>

<p>
<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is mostly programmed in C with some core components in C++ (<a href="http://mess.redump.net/reference:mame_and_mess_source_layout" class="wikilink1" title="reference:mame_and_mess_source_layout">here</a> you can see an overview of the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> source structure), and shares its core and CPU emulation with <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>. This allows <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> to offer the same powerful interface and flexible options which <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> offers for arcade emulation.
</p>

<p>
<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> can currently emulate over 550 individual systems from the last 5 decades.

<div class="level2">

<p>

The primary purpose of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is to preserve decades of computer and console history. As technology continues to rush forward, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> prevents these important “vintage” systems from being lost and forgotten. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is based on <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> and shares many of its components.

 and to extract its content to a folder. You will end up with many files
 (below you find explanations about some of these), and in particular 
with mess.exe and messui.exe.

<h2><a name="requirements" id="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is written 
in fairly generic C/C++, and has been ported to numerous platforms. Over
 time, as computer hardware has evolved, the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> code has evolved as well to take advantage of the greater processing power and hardware capabilities offered.
</p>

<p>
The official <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> binaries are compiled and designed to run on a standard Windows-based system. The minimum requirements are:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Any MMX-capable AMD or Intel processor (Pentium III or later recommended for current versions)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Windows 98 or later (Windows 2000 or later preferred)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> DirectX 5.0 or later (included with all versions of Windows 98 or later)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A DirectDraw or Direct3D capable graphics card</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Any DirectSound capable sound card</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Of course, the minimum requirements are just that: minimal. You may not get optimal performance from such a system, but <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> should run. Modern versions of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> require more power than older versions, so if you have a less-capable PC, you may find that using an older version of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> may get you better performance, at the cost of lowered accuracy and fewer supported systems.
</p>

<p>
As of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> 0.106 and later, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 will take advantage of 3D hardware for compositing artwork and scaling 
the games to full screen. To make use of this, you should have a modern 
Direct3D 8-capable video card with at least 16MB of video RAM.
</p>

<p>
Around the same time, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 added minimal multi-processor support, if you use the -mt flag. This 
means that some of the video processing can be done on a second CPU core
 if it is available. To take advantage of this, you should run <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> on a dual core (or greater) system.
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind that even on the fastest computers available, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 is still incapable of playing some systems at full speed. The goal of 
the project isn't to make all system run speedy on your system; the goal
 is to document the hardware and reproduce the behavior of the hardware 
as faithfully as possible.

Most of the systems emulated by <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 requires a dump of the internal chips of the original system. These can
 be obtained by extracting the data from an original unit, or finding 
them (at your own risk) in the WorldWideWeb. Being copyrighted material,
 <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> does not come with any of these.
</p>

<p>
Also, you may want  to find some software to be run on the emulated machine. Again, <a href="http://www.google.com/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">Google</a> and other search engines are your best friends. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 does not provide any software to be run on the emulated machines 
because it is very often (almost always, in the case of console 
software) copyrighted material.

<h2><a name="using_mess" id="using_mess">Using MESS</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

If you are a new <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> user, you could find this emulator a bit complex at first. The basic usage, from command line, is
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe &lt;system&gt; &lt;media&gt; &lt;software&gt; &lt;options&gt;</pre>

<p>
where
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> &lt;system&gt; is the shortname of the system you want to emulate (e.g. <code>nes</code>, <code>c64</code>, etc.)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> &lt;media&gt; is the switch for the media you want to load (if it's a cartridge, try <code>-cart</code> or <code>-cart1</code>; if it's a floppy disk, try <code>-flop</code> or <code>-flop1</code>; if it's a CD-ROM, try <code>-cdrom</code>)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> &lt;software&gt; is the program / 
game you want to load (and it can be given either as the fullpath to the
 file to load, or as the shortname of the file in our <a href="#software_lists" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">software lists</a>)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> &lt;options&gt; is any additional <a href="#command_line_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">command line option</a> for controllers, video, sound, etc.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Remember that if you type a &lt;system&gt; name which does not correspond to any emulated system, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 will suggest you some possible choices which are close to what you 
typed; and if you don't know which &lt;media&gt; switch are available, 
you can always launch
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe &lt;system&gt; -listmedia</pre>

<p>

If you don't know what &lt;options&gt; are available, you have many possibilities. First of all, you can check the <a href="#command_line_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">command line options</a> section of this Manual. Moreover, since <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> shares most of its core components with <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> (and its Windows <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> with MAMEUI), any guide for <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> would fit perfectly for <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> as well, giving you directions about <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> options. 
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you should keep in mind the following command line options, which might be very useful in this context: <code>help</code>, <code>showusage</code> (or briefly <code>su</code>), <code>showconfig</code> (or briefly <code>sc</code>) and <code>createconfig</code> (or briefly <code>cc</code>).
</p>

<p>
If you launch at command line
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -help</pre>

<p>
you will be explained what <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is the basic structure of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> launching options, i.e. as explained above
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe &lt;system&gt; &lt;media&gt; &lt;software&gt; &lt;options&gt;</pre>

<p>

If you launch at command line
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -showusage</pre>

<p>
you will be prompted with the (quite long) list of available command line options for <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>. The main options are described below, in the <a href="#command_line_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Command Line Options</a> section of this manual. You can also read all the command line options at the <a href="http://mess.redump.net/mess:usage" class="wikilink1" title="mess:usage">usage</a> page of this wiki.
</p>

<p>
If you launch at command line
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -showconfig</pre>

<p>
you will be prompted with the (quite long) list of available configuration options for <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>. These configuration can always be modified at command line, or by editing them in <code>mess.ini</code> which is the main configuration file for <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>. You can find a description of some configuration options in the <a href="#command_line_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Command Line Options</a>
 section of this manual (usually, to each configuration option there 
corresponds a command line option to configure and modify it). You can 
also read all the configuration options at the <a href="http://mess.redump.net/mess:mess.ini" class="wikilink1" title="mess:mess.ini">mess.ini</a> page of this wiki.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you launch at command line
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -createconfig</pre>

<p>
you will create a brand new <a href="http://mess.redump.net/mess:mess.ini" class="wikilink1" title="mess:mess.ini">mess.ini</a>
 file, with default configuration settings.  Notice that mess.ini is 
basically a plain text file, hence you can open it with any text editor 
(e.g. Notepad, Emacs or TextEdit) and configure every option you need. 
However, no particular tweaks are needed to start, so you can basically 
leave most of the options unaltered the first times you use <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>.
</p>

<p>
<em>[maybe the -soft opengl option for (SDL)<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> should be mentioned here…]</em>
</p>

<p>
Once you are more confident with <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> options, you may want to configure a bit more your setup. In this case, keep in mind the order in which options are read:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> starts with all the default settings</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> overwrites the modified options found in .ini files, if any; in particular <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> reads in order</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> mess.ini found in the same directory of the emulator, if any</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> mess.ini again (so that, if you 
specified an alternative path for .ini files in the main mess.ini, this 
new location will be checked)</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> driver.ini (so that, if you are 
interested e.g. in msx clones, you can modify all their options at once 
by using a single msx.ini configuration file)</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> parent.ini (so that… )</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> system.ini (so that.. )</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> overwrites the modified options passed to command line</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

Therefore, options set at command line have precedence over anything you
 have set in .ini files, while unspecified options fall back to their 
default values.
</p>

<p>
<em>TO DO: check if the ini part is 100% correct and add explanations about parent and system .inis </em>

Then, you need the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> source, of course. You can either take the whole tree from the svn repository (see <a href="http://www.mess.org/download.php" class="urlextern" title="http://www.mess.org/download.php" rel="nofollow">this page</a>), or download latest stable source (see again <a href="http://www.mess.org/download.php" class="urlextern" title="http://www.mess.org/download.php" rel="nofollow">this page</a>) and add to it the corresponding version of the <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> source. The svn is however the recommended choice, because of the frequent updates.
</p>

<p>
Once you have both sources, to compile the command line version of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is enough to open a command prompt and type (assuming MinGW has been correctly installed as explained at <a href="http://mamedev.org/tools/" class="urlextern" title="http://mamedev.org/tools/" rel="nofollow">MAME build tools page</a>)
</p>
<pre class="code">make TARGET=mess</pre>

<p>
Please notice the capital letters for <code>TARGET</code>: if you use <code>target=mess</code> it won't work.
</p>

<p>
Other possible compile options are the following
</p>
<pre class="code">DEBUG=1
SYMBOLS=1</pre>

<p>
The former enables stricter validation inside the emulator and some 
additional logging (but notice that the basic debugger is compiled even 
without this option, and it is hence available in <strong>all</strong> builds). The latter enables symbols in the compile, to make easier the debugging of crashes through <code>gdb</code>.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can use Visual C to compile <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>.
 Indeed, if you add MSVC_BUILD=1 at the compile command, the build will 
use Visual C instead of MinGW. Note that MinGW is still required, as GNU
 make is used rather than nmake. Using the Microsoft compilers allows to
 use the Visual C debugger to debug <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, but one does not get the full benefits of the IDE.
</p>

<p>
If you want to compile MESSUI, then you need to type
</p>
<pre class="code">make TARGET=mess OSD=winui</pre>

<p>
This also compiles the alternative Internal New UI (which can then be enabled the <code>-menu</code> option).
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you want to compile the Tools (e.g. chdman, imgtool and castool), then you need to type
</p>
<pre class="code">make TARGET=mess tools</pre>

<p>
(if you forget the “TARGET=mess” part you will end up only compiling the <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> tools).

<div class="level4">

<p>

Starting from version 0.137, the SDL component of <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>/<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> are included in the official source. 
</p>

<p>
Therefore, to compile <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> you only need to download the source from <a href="http://www.mess.org/download.php" class="urlextern" title="http://www.mess.org/download.php" rel="nofollow">this page</a> (and to add the <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> source), or to checkout the svn repository (see <a href="http://www.mess.org/download.php" class="urlextern" title="http://www.mess.org/download.php" rel="nofollow">this page</a> for instructions about svn). 
</p>

<p>
Required packages and instructions about compiling (SDL)<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> are the same used to compile (SDL)<acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> and can be found following the links at <a href="http://www.bannister.org/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=35138#Post35138" class="urlextern" title="http://www.bannister.org/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=35138#Post35138" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.
 In general, you only need a compatible version of GCC (sometimes latest
 bleeding edge versions may cause compile issues), the SDL libraries and
 the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> &amp; <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> sources: the makefile has been written so that typing 
</p>
<pre class="code">make TARGET=mess</pre>

<p>
is enough to correctly compile the right version for your setup, by automatically choosing the appropriate <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym> and selecting between 32-bit and 64-bit architecture.
The only case which require and additional option is if you want an SDL build in Windows. In this case, you have to type
</p>
<pre class="code">make TARGET=mess OSD=sdl</pre>

<p>

Notice that, if you are using MacOSX 10.6, the default settings is to 
compile a 32-bit executable. At your own risk, you might try to compile <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> in 64-bit too by typing
</p>
<pre class="code">make TARGET=mess PTR64=1</pre>

<p>
This is not officially endorsed, but it produces a slightly faster executable and there have been no issues reported so far.
</p>

<p>
Please notice the capital letters for <code>TARGET</code>: if you use <code>target=mess</code> it won't work.
</p>

<p>
Other possible compile options are the following
</p>
<pre class="code">DEBUG=1
SYMBOLS=1</pre>

<p>
The former enables stricter validation inside the emulator and some 
additional logging (but notice that the basic debugger is compiled even

<div class="level2">

<p>

As mentioned in the <a href="#requirements" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Requirements</a> section, to run most of the supported machines in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>,
 you need BIOSes files, i.e. files which represent an exact copy of the 
content of chips present inside the real systems. Once you have these 
files, you can

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> either zip them up in a filed called <code>&lt;system&gt;.zip</code> and put them in the roms/ folder (where &lt;system&gt; is the machine you want to emulate, e.g. you need a <code>msx.zip</code> file in the roms/ directory for the <acronym title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</acronym> MSX to work)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> or create a system/ subfolder in the roms/ folder and put the uncompressed files into this subfolder (again <em>system</em> is the machine you want to emulate, e.g. you need a roms/msx/ subfolder to store your uncompressed MSX BIOS)</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Notice that you can modify the location of the BIOSes by setting the -rompath option (see <a href="#command_line_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Command Line Options</a>) to something different than roms/ . You can also setting it to roms/ <strong>and</strong> a second folder of your choice. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Tips</strong> - <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 can load zipped BIOSes based on their CRC checksum. Hence, if you have a
 correct BIOS zipped in the roms/ folder, the names of the single files 
are not really important. However, if you keep your BIOS unzipped, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> cannot load the files by CRC and you need the BIOS files to be named in a very precise way. If you keep receiving a <code>missing files</code>
 error message and you think you have already the required files 
unzipped in a subfolder of the roms/ folder, check if their names are 
correct.

<h2><a name="software_handling" id="software_handling">Software Handling</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

There exists no hardcoded software locations in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> and you can configure <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> to launch software from any directory you want.
</p>

<p>
If you are running <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 from command line, you simply have to specify the full path to the 
software. E.g. to launch a Sharp X1 floppy disk that you have in 
“E:\sharp x1\disk.d88”, you just have to type
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe x1 -flop1 "E:\sharp x1\disk.d88"</pre>

<p>
Notice the quote around the path, to properly handle the space in the folder name.
</p>

<p>
While running <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you can also change software by entering the Internal UI (press <kbd>Tab</kbd>), choosing <code>File Manager</code>,
 selecting the device you want to use (Cartslots, Cassettes, Floppy 
Disks, Cdroms, etc.) and browsing your folders until you find the 
desired software image.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Tips</strong> - In the <code>File Manager</code>, the navigation
 through folders filled of hundreds of files can be made a lot faster, 
if you know a couple of features of the Internal UI! First of all, <kbd>PgUp</kbd>, <kbd>PgDn</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> are fully supported and allow for faster scroll of the list of filenames. Moreover, as of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 0.142, you can type the beginning of a filename, and the File Manager 
will scroll until the file with the closest name. Adding the fact that 
you can click with the mouse of the file to start it, finding the file 
you want to launch has never been so easy!
</p>

<p>
If you are using MESSUI on Windows, you can also easily set up some 
software folders for each emulated system and then select the software 
image you want in the file picker window.
Namely, select from the menu <code>Options</code> and then <code>Directories</code>. From the drop-down list choose <code>Software</code> and click on <code>Insert</code> or on <code>Browse</code>. Navigate to the root of your software folder, click ok and you are done.
</p>

<p>
Now, on the right you can see a section for software selection: two tabs are available, “Picker” and “Device View”. 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The Device View shows the available 
media with the software that is currently loaded, and a selection box 
where you may Mount, Create or Unmount an image.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The Picker lists every compatible software that is contained in the selected software directory, including subdirectories.</div>
</li>

</p>

<p>

<p>

In addition to the BIOS images, to fully enjoy emulation of a system you
 will need also some software. Again, this is copyrighted material and 
it is up to you to find it. However, once you have found it, you can 
load it in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> 
by simply pointing the emulator to the right directory, e.g. to run 
Atari 2600 with an image of the cart Frogger in .a26 format, you need to
 launch

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe a2600 -cart "C:\path_to_image\frogger.a26"</pre>

<p>

Some systems (usually consoles) do not start in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 without an image (which would correspond to a cartridge inserted in the
 cartslot of the console). Other systems (e.g. all the computers) would 
start also without any software mounted. As an example, running

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe c64</pre>

<p>

would prompt you to the BASIC “ready” screen. Different systems supports in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> different types of images and different media. You can check supported media devices and file extensions by using the <code>-listmedia</code> option (also described <a href="#emulated_media_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">here</a>). E.g.

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe apple2gs -listmedia</pre>

<p>

for specific Apple ||gs emulation or

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -listmedia</pre>

<p>

for a list of all supported media and file extensions for each system. 
You can always change the software you have loaded in a device by 
entering the Internal UI (pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd>) and selecting “File Manager” (see <a href="#internal_ui_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">below</a>).
</p>

<p>
As of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> 0.138, a new option for launching a system with software has been added: <strong>launch from software lists</strong>.
 This new option is based on the inclusion of software lists, in .xml 
format, containing checksums of known dumps, and it works a bit more 
like <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>, in the sense that to e.g. launch SNES emulation of Super Mario World requires the following command

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe snes -cart smwu</pre>

<p>

where “smwu” must be the proper image which is listed in the software 
lists “snes.xml”. You can find more details about this new option in the

<h2><a name="tips" id="tips">Tips</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

To simplify the use of some system, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> introduces a few features that are not always known to the user:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The whole Internal UI is completely clickable with the mouse. Start command line <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 with a double click, and you will be prompted with a random list of the
 systems you can launch. Click on one of them and the emulation will 
start. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> during the emulation and you will enter 
again the Internal UI which allows you to configure Inputs, Video and 
Sound options by simply clicking on them with your mouse (a complete 
description of the available options can be found below…)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> In the <code>File Manager</code> and in the <code>Software List</code>
 menu, the navigation through folders filled of hundreds of files can be
 made a lot faster, if you know a couple of features of the Internal UI!
 First of all, <kbd>PgUp</kbd>, <kbd>PgDn</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> are fully supported and allow for faster scroll of the list of filenames. Moreover, as of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 0.142, you can type the beginning of a filename, and the File Manager 
will scroll until the file with the closest name. Adding the fact that 
you can click with the mouse of the file to start it, finding the file 
you want to launch has never been so easy!</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> For many calculator and chess computers, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> provides an artwork which depicts the original aspect of the emulated machine (see also the <a href="#artwork_folder" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Artwork</a> section). In the <code>Video options</code>
 menu of the UI, you can turn it on or off. When the artwork is used, 
you can also click with the mouse on the keys that you see to produce 
the expected effect on the emulated machine rather than using keyboard 
inputs. If you find a system using an artwork but not working when you 
click on it, please report it on the <a href="http://www.bannister.org/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&amp;Board=1&amp;page=1" class="urlextern" title="http://www.bannister.org/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&amp;Board=1&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">MESS message board</a> (this feature is not currently supported in every system with an artwork, but we are working on it).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> When emulating a computer in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>,
 you may want to try some BASIC program you have found in internet. 
However, the process of writing them in the emulated system is usually 
quite tedious. This is why <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 allows you to directly paste into the emulated system whatever text you
 copy from a file! Simply select the program / command you want to 
enter, copy it (e.g. by using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> on Windows) and paste it in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>ScrLock</kbd> (this is the default key sequence, but you can remap it to any key you want entering the Internal UI, choosing <code>Inputs (general)</code> and then <code>User Interface</code>).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 can load zipped BIOSes based on their CRC checksum. Hence, if you have a
 correct BIOS zipped in the roms/ folder, the names of the single files 
are not really important. However, if you keep your BIOS unzipped, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> cannot load the files by CRC and you need the BIOS files to be named in a very precise way. If you keep receiving a <code>missing files</code>
 error message and you think you have already the required files 
unzipped in a subfolder of the roms/ folder, check if their names are 
correct.</div>

<h2><a name="mess.ini" id="mess.ini">mess.ini</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

This is probably the most important file when you use <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, since it contains all the configuration settings which are used by <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>. By changing mess.ini, you can use to configure every aspect of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>.
 Many configuration options and the corresponding command line commands 
are described in separate sections of this User's Manual and you can 
find a detailed description of configuration each option at the <a href="http://mess.redump.net/mess:mess.ini" class="wikilink1" title="mess:mess.ini">mess.ini</a>  page of this wiki. 
</p>

<p>
If you cannot find mess.ini in your <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> folder, you can easily create a new mess.ini containing default settings by launching from command line
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -cc</pre>

<p>
or
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -createconfig</pre>

<p>
Afterwards, you can always edit this file and the configuration values 
by opening and editing it with a text editor. The same command can be 
also handy if you want to reset every option to its default value at 
once, because the new mess.ini will overwrite the one already present.
</p>

<p>
It is recommended that you modify the writeconfig setting to 1.
</p>
<pre class="code">writeconfig   1</pre>

<p>
Save your changes. Then, copy your new mess.ini to the ini folder.

<h2><a name="roms_folder" id="roms_folder">roms/ Folder</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

As in <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>, 
this is the default folder for roms. The main difference is that in this
 case '“roms” refers to BIOS roms of the various supported systems. 
Therefore, to emulate <code>snes</code> in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> you just need to put its BIOS in a zipfile named snes.zip inside the roms/ folder (more information about BIOS handling in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> can be found at <a href="#bios_handling" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">here</a>).
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, software can be put in any directory you want, as long as the whole software location is passed to <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> at launch. E.g. to play the game foo.smc on snes, it is enough to the correct snes.zip into roms/ and launch at command line

<h2><a name="nvram_folder_.nv_files" id="nvram_folder_.nv_files">nvram/ Folder &amp; .nv Files</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

.nv files, created in the nvram/ folder by default, represent the 
content of each 'Non Volatile RAM' device present on the original system
 (or in its software). A typical example is provided by console carts 
which were able to store in SRAM the progresses of the player. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 backups the system nvram in a nvram/&lt;system&gt;.nv file and software
 nvram in nvram/&lt;system&gt;/&lt;software&gt;.nv files. Next time you 
launch <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, it 
will look in those locations to load the content of saved memory.
These files only contains the NVRAM data that would have been saved in 
the original systems. For other kind of saving you have to refer to <a href="#save_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Savestates</a>, which are completely unrelated.

 in the Internal UI). If you experience any problem after changing these
 settings and/or you want to restore default settings and controls, you 
just have to delete from cfg/ folder the file &lt;system&gt;.cfg or

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> looks into this folder to find artworks: as for <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>
 artworks, these are overlay files which can make easier or more 
satisfactory the emulation. Typical examples are images of calculators, 
pocket computers and chess computers which allow a much more faithful 
experience than the simple LED display.
<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> also 
supports clickable artworks which are very useful for calculators, 
pocket computers and chess computers: by clicking on the keys shown in 
the artwork, you will pass the corresponding inputs to the emulated 
system!

If you had set writeconfig to 1 (as noted in the mess.ini section 
above), each system will have its own ini file created the first time 
you run that system. Each ini file is a complete copy of mess.ini, thus 
you can customise the settings for each individual system.
</p>

<p>
When you mount an image (cartridge, tape, etc), that information is 
saved in the system's ini file, to be remembered for next time. This is 
important for the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>, because when you choose a game from the software picker, it saves that information to the ini file.
</p>

<p>
If for some reason you have an unexpected problem with a system, just 
delete the corresponding ini file, and the defaults will be used next 
time.

This folder contains .hsi files and .xml software lists for <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>. 
</p>

<p>
.hsi files are xml-like files which contain CRC checksums of software 
image, information about software known issues (e.g. if a file is a bad 
dump, has been overdumped with garbage data etc.) and/or specific 
settings used by <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> to handle software for certain systems. Among others, .hsi files help <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 to identify NES mappers and Intellivision banking schemes based on the 
checksums of the file images. Most of the .hsi files are based on 
GoodTools information (thanks to Cowerings) but, since the files can be 
read and edited with any text editor, you can create your own .hsi file 
if you want to.
</p>

<p>
.xml software lists are used to identify known dumps and to assign them a <code>shortname</code> which can be used to load the software from command line or from Internal UI or <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>.

files can be found at <a href="http://www.mameworld.info/ubbthreads/postlist.php?Cat=&amp;Board=emuadvice" class="urlextern" title="http://www.mameworld.info/ubbthreads/postlist.php?Cat=&amp;Board=emuadvice" rel="nofollow">Emuadvice Mameworld Forum</a> (these are for <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>, but they work in the same way in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>). To enable such effect files, you can select them in <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> or load them at command line with the option <code>-effect</code>
The .png files must be uncompressed and located in the artwork directory (artwork/ by default). You load them by launching, e.g.
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -effect aperture1x2rb</pre>

<p>
which will force <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> to overlay the screen output with a tiled aperture1x2rb.png pattern, if you have aperture1x2rb.png in the artwork folder.

<p>

Sharing its core with <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 is a very powerful and flexible emulator. This results in a very large 
number of command line options available, which can easily lead the user
 to some confusion.
However, in general, most options can be set once and then seldom 
modified: for this reason is important to keep in mind that to each 
option below (and to the ones described in the <a href="#video_option" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Video Options</a>, <a href="#sound_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Sound Options</a> and <a href="#input_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Input Options</a> sections of the Manual) there correspond a configuration option in mess.ini.
Editing a configuration option in <a href="http://mess.redump.net/mess:mess.ini" class="wikilink1" title="mess:mess.ini">mess.ini</a> will force <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 to change that particular aspect of the emulation every time it is 
launched, exactly as if you would pass the corresponding command line 
option at launch.
This approach allows you to only remember a couple of options when you 
are starting emulation, namely the ones that you want to overwrite for a
 particular system (and also in this case you may want to modify them 
once for all creating a &lt;system&gt;.ini file, where “system” is the 
computer or console you want to emulate)
</p>

<p>
Also, remember that if you are using <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> version for Windows or if you are using <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 in conjunction with a frontend, you can set your favorite configuration
 options through the graphical interface rather than launching emulation
 from command line. The option in the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> should have the same name of the Command Line / Configuration ones.
</p>

<p>
Notice that here we list and discuss only general <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 options, and only the main ones. For Video, Sound and Input options,

<h2><a name="rom_verification_options" id="rom_verification_options">ROM Verification Options</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> offers the 
possibility to verify if the romset you are using contains all the files
 required for the emulation. You can simply launch the following command
 to test your romset for “system”

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -verifyroms &lt;system&gt;</pre>

<p>
In the case of e.g. a800pal, you must of course use 
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe -verifyroms a800pal</pre>

<p>
If the romset is exactly the one needed by <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you can receive either a
</p>
<pre class="code">romset &lt;system&gt; is good</pre>

<p>
or a
</p>
<pre class="code">romset &lt;system&gt; is best available</pre>

<p>
message. The former indicates that you have all you need to run emulation in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>;
 the latter can appear when the known dump has some issue (e.g. it needs
 to be redumped or it misses some currently undumped components). In 
this case, emulation may work or not, depending on the importance of the
 missing components. However, it also means that no one has a better 
dump, so you cannot do much to improve your romset.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if the whole romset is missing you will receive a 
</p>
<pre class="code">romset "&lt;system&gt;" not found!</pre>

<p>
message
</p>

<p>
Finally, if your romset is not complete or it contains wrong ROMs, you will receive a
</p>
<pre class="code">romset &lt;system&gt; is bad</pre>

<p>
message, with indication of which files are missing and/or wrong.If your
 romset is not good, the only thing you can do is to look for a good 
one.
Also, notice that, if “system” is a clone, i.e. if it could share some 
ROMs with another system, as in the a800pal case above, you would 
receive a message like

</p>
<pre class="code">romset a800pal [a800] is best available</pre>

<p>

where the <code>[a800]</code> part means that <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> has also looked for the roms in the parent romset, if present.
</p>

<p>
If you don't specify any system after the <code>-verifyroms</code> option, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> will verify the romsets for every supported system.

<p>

Basically every directory settings can be customized in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, both in the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>, in mess.ini and at command line. Namely, you can modify the default locations in which <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> looks for needed files (BIOS ROMs, hash files, artworks etc.) and the default directories in which <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> stores outputs files (cfg, nvram, inp, snapshots etc.).
</p>

<p>
The former ones can be modified by using the following options, 
recalling that you have to enter the absolute path for each directory:
</p>
<pre class="code">-rompath [for BIOS ROMs]
-hashpath [for hash files]
-artpath [for artworks]
-ctrlrpath [for controller files]
-inipath [for alternative ini files]

<div class="level4">

<p>

With this option (turned ON by default), <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>

nothing is going on. However, you may want to switch it OFF on some 
laptops, to improve performances.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="speed" id="speed">-speed</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

With this option you can force <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> to run a system faster than its normal speed. E.g. 
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe kaypro2 -speed 1.5</pre>

<p>
will force <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> to run Kaypro 2 emulation at 1.5 times its normal speed.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="refreshspeed" id="refreshspeed">-refreshspeed</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

With this option <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 will match its speed to user's monitor refresh rate, to prevent sound 
hiccups and to ensure a smoother scrolling. However, some adjustment may
 be still needed by playing a bit with this an the -speed option. 
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="throttle" id="throttle">-throttle</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

With this option, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 will try to keep the emulated system running in real time. If you 
switch it off (with -nothrottle), the game will run as fast as your CPU 
specs allows, ignoring CPU speed and screen refresh of the emulated 
machines.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="str" id="str">-str</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

With this option, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> will run for a given amount of seconds and then will exit emulation. E.g.

<div class="level2">

<p>

If an emulated system cannot run 100% on your system, you might want to 
sacrifice some frame here and there to avoid slowdowns. This can be 
obtained by using  <code>-autoframeskip</code>.
<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> will try to 
keep the speed of the game as closer as possible to the intended one, 
automatically choosing how many frames to drop.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can tell <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> how many frames out of 12 to drop, by setting <code>-frameskip n</code> at launch, with <code>n</code> an integer number between 0 (default) and 12. You can also change this setting during emulation by pressing <kbd>F8</kbd> and <kbd>F9</kbd> (see the <a href="#key_functions" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Key Functions</a> section).
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind that dropping too many frames will cause the game to become more jerky and stuttery.

For emulated computers and calculators, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> offers two different way to translate the keyboard of the original system into the keyboard of your computer: 

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> the <strong>emulated</strong> mode, in which original keys are mapped to your keyboard based on their position (e.g. <kbd>Z</kbd> could be mapped on your <kbd>Y</kbd>
 if you're emulating a QWERTZ keyboard with your QWERTY one): this can 
sound a bit unnatural, but it can be handy when you're looking for an 
unusual key which was only used by home computers in the '80s and has no
 correspondent key on modern keyboard (e.g. Atari or Commodore function 
keys on 8 bit home computers); also you can remap every single key by 
pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> and entering the <code>Input (this System)</code> menu of the Internal UI</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> the <strong>natural</strong> mode, in which original keys are mapped to the equivalent keys of your keyboard when present (e.g. your <kbd>Y</kbd>
 always produces a 'Y', no matter if the keyboard in the emulated system
 was QWERTY or QWERTZ); this is more natural to be used but some keys 
are lost in the translation, e.g. again the old Atari or Commodore 
function keys have no equivalent on modern keyboards.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

By default, you start <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> in emulated mode. However, you can start emulation in natural mode by using the <code>-natural</code> option at command line or by changing the corresponding configuration option in mess.ini.

<h2><a name="overview1" id="overview1">Overview</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

As of 0.138 release, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 has added support for software lists in xml format to document the 
games &amp; programs which have been released for various consoles and 
home computers, much like the source already does for the systems 
themselves and <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>
 does for the arcade games.
At the moment, not all the systems are covered, but the plan is to 
extend the support to most systems, given the high risk for info on 
obscure and not so obscure systems &amp; software to be lost forever. 
</p>

<p>
The software lists are stored in the hash/ directory and are released 
together with the emulation. Hence, you should have them already both if
 you download the current <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 release and if you downloaded the latest svn. Alternatively, you can 
download the various xml lists (or check their content) from our <a href="http://git.redump.net/cgit.cgi/mess/plain/hash/" class="urlextern" title="http://git.redump.net/cgit.cgi/mess/plain/hash/" rel="nofollow">git repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
Notice that software lists are an additional documentation effort of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>,
 but they are not going to completely replace fullpath loading. Indeed, 
we are fully aware that part of the fun when emulating an home computer 
is the capability for the user to run its own software, and therefore 
loading by fullpath will always remain available as well.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: by mistake, in version 0.142 the lists have been 
only included in the source pack and not in the exe pack, please get 
them from the git repository until next version is released

</p>

</div>
<!-- SECTION "Overview" [59923-61331] -->
<h2><a name="list_format" id="list_format">List Format</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

We have chosen a (minimal) format which contains a <strong>shortname</strong> for each game (like <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> shortnames), a <strong>description</strong> (which should match the title screen, or the box screen if no title screen exists), the <strong>release year</strong>, the <strong>publisher name</strong> and the <strong>CRC32/SHA1 checksums</strong>,
 plus some additional fields that helps either the emulation or the 
accurate description of the original hardware.
Additional info strictly concerning the software, like available 
languages, programmers names, cheats, etc. can be stored externally in 
datfiles to be displayed by front-ends.
</p>

<p>
More info about our software list format can be found in the <a href="http://mess.redump.net/mess:swlist_format" class="wikilink1" title="mess:swlist_format">appropriate Wiki page</a>.
</p>

</div>
<!-- SECTION "List Format" [61332-62039] -->
<h2><a name="setting_up_lists" id="setting_up_lists">Setting Up Lists</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

By default, software lists in .xml format are stored in the hash/ directory inside the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 directory. You can however decide to store them elsewhere (or in 
multiple paths), by adding the corresponding directories with the <code>hashpath</code> option.
</p>

</div>
<!-- SECTION "Setting Up Lists" [62040-62314] -->
<h2><a name="setting_up_software" id="setting_up_software">Setting Up Software</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

Software storage is slightly more complicate than list storage. The 
basic principles is that software for each list should be stored in a 
directory named after the list name and placed inside your roms/ 
directory. E.g. the Epoch Super Cassette Vision carts, which belong to 
the scv.xml list, should be stored in a <code>roms/scv/</code> directory and the Sharp X68000 floppies, which belong to the x68k_flop.xml list, should be stored in a <code>roms/x68k_flop/</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
In this way, you can separately store the software of different systems 
and the different media of each system (e.g. carts separated from disks 
separated from tapes).
</p>

<p>
Of course, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> 
also allows you to store your carts in different folders than “roms”, 
e.g. you can use “C:\console_games\snes” and “C:\console_games\gbcolor”,
 as long as you add the root directory “C:\console_games” to your 
rompaths in mess.ini. The only things you have to care about is that the
 subfolders (“snes” and “gbcolor”, in the examples above) are correctly 
named as the software lists they refer to.
</p>

<p>
Notice that, for helping development, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 also looks for list items directly in the roms/ directory. Hence, you 
can in principle store all your software in the rompath, together with 
the bios files, even if it is not the recommended setup.
</p>

</div>
<!-- SECTION "Setting Up Software" [62315-63632] -->
<h2><a name="usage_from_command_line" id="usage_from_command_line">Usage from Command Line</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

If you have stored the software roms as explained above, and you want to
 launch “Super Mario Land” for the Game Boy (which corresponds to the 
shortname <code>sml</code> in gameboy.xml), then you simply have to type
</p>
<pre class="code">mess gameboy -cart sml</pre>

<p>
and <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> will load the game. 
</p>

<p>
Notice that if you type the wrong shortname, then a few best match 
suggestions will be prompted to you, so that you can amend the game 
name.
</p>

<p>
And if you want to launch “Ancient Ys Vanished Omen” for the Fujitsu FM7 (which corresponds to the shortname <code>ys</code> in fm7_disk.xml), you can simply type
</p>
<pre class="code">mess fm7 -flop1 ys</pre>

<p>
or 
</p>
<pre class="code">mess fm7 -flop2 ys</pre>

<p>
depending on which disk drive you want to use. In fact, you can also use
</p>
<pre class="code">mess fm7 -flop1 ys -flop2 ys</pre>

<p>
but in this case you end up mount the first disk of the game in both disk drives.
</p>

<p>
If you want to mount different disks in the various drives, you can do 
that as well! To load e.g. the third disk of the game in the second 
drive, you have to use the following command
</p>
<pre class="code">mess fm7 -flop1 ys -flop2 ys:flop3</pre>

<p>
where the <code>:flop3</code> part tells <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 to load the data corresponding to the “flop3” part in the xml file. If 
you specify a part which does not exist (e.g. because of a typo or 
because you think a game has more disks than there really are), <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 will revert to loading the first disk in the drive and you will have to
 change disk during emulation, through the File Manager in the Internal 
UI.
</p>

<p>
Also, notice that some systems in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 support not only their own lists but also some compatible ones. For 
example, gbcolor supports gameboy.xml as compatible list, in addition to
 its own gbcolor.xml list of carts. This means that you can load any 
gameboy game in gbcolor: using the same “Super Mario Land” example 
above, you can launch <code>sml</code> in the Game Boy Color, by using the following command
</p>
<pre class="code">mess gbcolor -cart gameboy:sml</pre>

<p>
where the <code>gameboy:</code> part tells <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> that <code>sml</code>
 belongs to the gameboy.xml list. Similarly, you can load “Legend of 
Zelda Oracle of Ages” for the Game Boy Color (whose shortname is <code>zeldaage</code>) both in gbcolor with the command
</p>
<pre class="code">mess gbcolor -cart zeldaage</pre>

<p>
and in gameboy with the command
</p>
<pre class="code">mess gameboy -cart gbcolor:zeldaage</pre>

<p>
even in this specific case you will receive a “This Game Can Only Be 
Played on a Game Boy Color” message, as if you had plugged your “Oracle 
of Ages” cart inside an old Game Boy console.
</p>

<p>
Other examples of compatible lists are <code>wscolor.xml</code> for the Wonderswan, <code>wswan.xml</code> for Wonderswan Color, and <code>pce.xml</code> for SuperGrafx.
</p>

</div>
<!-- SECTION "Usage from Command Line" [63633-66169] -->
<h2><a name="usage_from_internal_ui" id="usage_from_internal_ui">Usage from Internal UI</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

In addition to support from command line, software lists are completely 
supported in the File Manager of the Internal UI. Once emulation is 
running, indeed, you can press <kbd>Tab</kbd> and select the <code>File Manager</code>.
 Once you have chosen a media device that you want to fill with an 
image, the File Manager allows you to browse your computer in search of 
the files to mount. Among available options, the third from top is the 
option you are looking for: <code>Software List</code>!
</p>

<p>
Once you have chosen it, you will be prompted with the available lists 
for the system you are running and the specific media device you had 
selected in the File Manager, including any available compatible list. 
In the examples above, when trying to load a FM7 floppy disk you would 
find here the “Fujitsu FM-7 Disk Images” and when trying to load a Game 
Boy cart you would find here both the “Nintendo Game Boy cartridges” and
 the “Nintendo Game Boy Color cartridges”.
</p>

<p>
Select the list you want, and you will access the menu with all the 
games present in our xml software list. Launching the game you want is 
now a matter of a click! And if you select a game which is composed of 
multiple media (e.g. multiple cdroms or multiple floppy disks), you will
 be prompted with a new submenu which allows you to select among the 
available parts the one you want to load.
</p>

<p>
Notice that by default games are ordered based on their shortname, but 
you can select the first option at top to display the list of games 
ordered by their description.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Tips</strong> - In the <code>Software List</code> menu, the navigation can be made a lot faster if you know a couple of features of the Internal UI! First of all, <kbd>PgUp</kbd>, <kbd>PgDn</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> are fully supported and allow for faster scroll of the list of filenames. Moreover, as of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 0.142, you can type the beginning of a filename, and the menu will 
scroll until the file with the closest name (which will be the closest 
shortname or the closest description, depending on the ordering you have
 chosen). Adding the fact that you can click with the mouse of the file 
to start it, finding the file you want to launch has never been so easy!
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note</strong> This specific entry of the Manual refers to latest svn builds. Some features have been indeed added after 0.142 got released.

Support for software lists in MESSUI is currently only partial. If you 
select a system which supports a software list, then you will see that 
there is an additional tab for the software entries that can be used to 
select a game and launch it. However, for systems which have multiple 
cartslots or multiple floppy drives, you can currently only load the 
software list item in the first slot (-cart1 or -flop1). If you want to 
load the item in any other slot you have to launch emulation from 
command line, or enter the emulation and use the File Manager to add 
images to the other slots.

<p>

One of the main reasons to have a database of known dumps, is to be able
 to identify spare files or dumps you do by yourself. This has been an 
appreciated feature in <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>
 for years, when dealing with arcade dumps, and we wanted to offer 
something similar for consoles and home computers. Software lists allow 
for this: indeed, if you have some unknown files in “C:\unk\files\”, 
then you can simply launch

</p>
<pre class="code">mess -romident C:\unk\files\</pre>

<p>

and <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> will 
compare size and checksums with the ones recognized by its source (for 
BIOS items) and by its software lists (for cart/floppy/tape items).

<h2><a name="using_software_lists_with_cmpro" id="using_software_lists_with_cmpro">Using Software Lists with cmpro</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

Software lists are not 100% integrated with clrmame, hence not 
everything is automated, but with some work at your end you can 
successfully use <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> xml lists with cmpro.
</p>

</div>

<h5><a name="single_list_handling" id="single_list_handling">Single list handling</a></h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
First of all, let assume you are only interested in a single software 
list, say the Arcadia one. Since at the moment clrmame cannot directly 
extract the list info from <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>,
 you have to manually feed the software list into the rommanager, by 
pointing cmpro directly to the arcadia.xml file in the “hash/” directory
 (by selecting “Add DatFile…” in the Profiler window, and browsing your 
HD until you find the “hash/” directory inside your <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 directory).
Once you have added the list to clrmame, a new profile will be created 
and, by loading it, you can finally setup the directory where you want 
to store your arcadia software, and rebuild any directory containing 
arcadia roms to create a romset compatible with <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>.
</p>

</div>

<h5><a name="multiple_lists_handling" id="multiple_lists_handling">Multiple lists handling</a></h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
Now, what if you want to get all the supported lists at once? In this 
case, a first dumb solution would be to repeat for each list the 
procedure above. However, there is also a smarter and easier procedure, 
thanks to the clrmame batchrun capabilities!
Indeed, to rebuild all the software lists at once, you can simply follow
 these steps:

</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> you point clrmame to all the lists 
you are interested in (by selecting “Add DatFile…” in the Profiler 
window and choosing the xml lists you want)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> after clrmame has created a new profile for each of the lists, you select all of them</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> by pressing Enter, you are prompted with a “Profile Batchrun” window where you can choose among plenty of batchrun options</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> in the Misc submenu, you select the 
fundamental “Create rompath for new dat” option and choose as root 
folder either your roms/ directory or any other rompath you like (you 
can leave “For rompath naming use” to its default value “Datfile Name 
Tag”)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> in the Rebuilder submenu, you select
 “Rebuilder run before scan” and “Use source folder”, and you enter the 
location of the directory which contains the roms you want to rebuild</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> you press OK and you wait for clrmame to do its job (remember to confirm OK when the statistics are prompted)</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

At the end, you will have the folders you need inside “roms/” and all 
the available roms will be in the correct location. Of course, at Step 
5. you can also select additional Rebuild and Scan options as you like, 
or you can decide to only Rebuild without scanning.
</p>

<p>
Notice that, after the first run, you can always select multiple 
profiles to scan more software lists at once, with or without any 
Rebuild procedure. 
</p>

</div>

<h5><a name="conclusion" id="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
Eventually, we hope to add better integration between clrmame and <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> software lists (e.g. clrmame could be able to choose proper batchrun options after simply parsing the <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> -listxml output), but for the time being the procedure described above should work for everyone with little effort.
</p>

</div>
<!-- SECTION "Using Software Lists with cmpro" [69934-72919] -->
<h2><a name="software_sources" id="software_sources">Software Sources</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

First of all, you should remember that software which have been released
 and sold, no matter how old, is still copyrighted material. Therefore, 
unless the original owner of the rights has released it for public use, 
it is illegal to download such a software.
</p>

<p>
In some countries, it is legal to make a backup copy of a software if 
you own it. In this case, you can indeed copy your software and use it 
with our lists. However, in many countries, even backup copies of the 
software you own is a sort of gray area.
</p>

<p>
As a result, we do not distribute any software with <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> and it is completely up to the user to look for it.
</p>

<p>
What we distribute is a series of files containing info about software 
titles and their checksums. Since our goal is to document <strong>accurately</strong> the original software, it is however of interest to explain where we got these info from.
</p>

<p>
Things change a lot depending on the media we are talking about and as such we cover them separately here.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="cartridges" id="cartridges">Cartridges</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

For carts, we have either relied directly on dumper's info or on 
collections like the no-intro ones, which currently represent the most 
up-to-date collection concerning carts for a lot of systems.
</p>

<p>
For pirate carts, info come usually or from alternative collections 
(like GoodTools or TOSEC), or from chinese dumpers and chinese message 
board members.
</p>

<p>
Overall, when you want to verify if the dump you have matches one of our
 software lists, you have to remember that we try to match the original 
cart contents as much as possible. Therefore, cart dumps in our lists do
 not have headers and consist on separate files if it is known that the 
cart contained more than one chip.
</p>

<p>
If you have a file in a different format, you can often recover the 
files with the expected checksums by following the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> open the file with an hex editor, 
and strip the header (whose size depends on the file format: e.g. the 
iNES and A78 header is typically 0x10 long).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> if you have a single file, while the
 list expect multiple ones, you can try to split the file you have 
according to the size expected by the list, and check if the resulting 
part gives you the right files.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

Point 1. could help for NES and A7800 mainly (not many other headered 
format are around), point 2. helps for sure with NES (separate PRG and 
CHR), with Coleco (most carts contained 8K rom chips only) and with 
latest additions to the SNES list.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note</strong> - Among current lists, lynx.xml still contains files with header. This is going to be rectified soon, anyway.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="cds" id="cds">CDs</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

For CDs, as for carts, we try to rely on the best collections available,
 which often means redump.org, but not always (e.g. they still haven't 
found a way to extract properly the content of PCE CDs). Then, we 
convert the available .bin + .cue files to .chd, following the 
instructions that you can find <a href="http://guru.mameworld.info/tutorials/dumping_cds_&amp;_hdds/index.html" class="urlextern" title="http://guru.mameworld.info/tutorials/dumping_cds_&amp;_hdds/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is usually enough to produce the .chd with the checksums expected by the software list.
</p>

<p>
Things become a bit messier when the only available rips are in 
.iso+.mp3 format. In this case, the conversion to .chd usually involve 
in mounting the image in a program like Daemon Tools and then ripping it
 as a real CD.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="floppy_disks_tapes" id="floppy_disks_tapes">Floppy Disks &amp; Tapes</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

For floppies and tapes the situation is not yet established. We 
currently use common formats like .imd or .td0 or .d88 (for disks), and 
.t77 or .tap (for tapes, which got converted internally to .wav at 
loading time), but we might decide in the future to witch to some better
 format if a good candidate appears.

</p>

Notice that, starting from <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 0.138, it is also possible to load images from software lists: 
instructions are the same as the ones described below (except you have

You can load a cartridge in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> it by simply launching

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe &lt;system&gt; -cart foo.ext</pre>

<p>

If a system supports more than one cartslot, you may need to replace <code>-cart</code> with either <code>-cart1</code> or <code>-cart2</code>.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, while the emulation is running, you can enter the Internal UI, choose the <code>File Manager</code> menu, select one of the <code>Cartslot</code>
 entries and browse your HD to find the cart file you want. After 
selecting it, the emulation will be automatically restarted with the 
cart inserted.
</p>

<p>
Notice that a few systems currently supports 'fake' multiple slots to 
allow the emulation of carts with multiple files. This will be fixed 
eventually with the introduction of a xml format for multi-file 
cartridge, but for the moment you may need to use <code>-cart1</code> &amp; <code>-cart2</code> also in this case.

<p>

For systems which support CD-ROM emulation, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> uses CHD file format. You can read a guide about how to create a CHD from a CD <a href="http://guru.mameworld.info/tutorials/dumping_cds_&amp;_hdds/index.html" class="urlextern" title="http://guru.mameworld.info/tutorials/dumping_cds_&amp;_hdds/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> , courtesy of The Guru. Once you have a CD-ROM image in CHD file, you can load it by simply launching

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe &lt;system&gt; -cdrom foo.chd</pre>

<p>

Alternatively, while the emulation is running, you can enter the Internal UI, choose the <code>File Manager</code> menu, select <code>Cdrom</code>
 and browse your HD to find the CHD file you want. After selecting it, 
the emulation will be automatically restarted with the CD inserted.

<h4><a name="loading_a_cassette_tape" id="loading_a_cassette_tape">Loading a Cassette / Tape</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

You can load a tape in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> it by simply launching

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe &lt;system&gt; -cass foo.ext</pre>

<p>

If a system supports more than one cassette drive, you may need to replace <code>-cass</code> with either <code>-cass1</code> or <code>-cass2</code>.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, while the emulation is running, you can enter the Internal UI, choose the <code>File Manager</code> menu, select one of the <code>Cassette</code>
 entries and browse your HD to find the tape file you want. After 
selecting it, the emulation will be automatically restarted with the 
cassette inserted. Depending on the system, you may need to manually 
press “Play” to start cassette loading (or, as in the c64 case, to type 
“LOAD” and to press “Play” afterward). To do this in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, simply enter the Internal UI, choose the <code>Tape Controls</code> menu and press “Play”. The same procedure goes for any other tape operation (“Rec”, “Stop”, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Notice that the loading procedure can be slow. However, you can speed up emulation with no bad consequence by pressing <kbd>Ins</kbd> in partial keyboard emulation mode.

<div class="level4">

<p>

For systems supporting cassettes, you can save programs to tape exactly 
as in the original machines. First of all, you need to have a cassette 
in the tape drive: enter the Internal UI in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, choose the <code>File Manager</code> menu and select <code>Create</code>
 to create a new cassette file (in .wav format) with any name of your 
choice. Now, you will see that a brand new tape file is inserted in the 
Cassette slot. 
Next step consists in using the procedure that you would have followed 
on the real machine to save on tape (e.g. for c64 you have to type SAVE 
after having written the program). Once the emulated computer is ready 
to save, you just have to press “Rec” on the cassette drive. In <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, this means to enter the Internal UI, select the <code>Tape Controls</code> menu and press “Rec”. At this point, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> will save the output to the .wav file you created. Next time you use <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you can also load the program again, exactly like a cassette on the emulated system!

One of the main interesting aspects, when you emulate old home 
computers, is the possibility to run on them programs you have written, 
or programs whose code is available in the net. 
However, having to type hundreds of lines of code into the emulated 
terminal is not so funny. This is one of the reasons you may love the 
pasting feature <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> offers. 
Indeed, with <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>,
 you can simply copy any kind of code from a webpage or a text file and 
then directly pasting it into the emulated computer. Once you have 
copied the text (e.g. with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> in Windows), you simply have to start the emulation and press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>ScrLock</kbd> (but, as usual, you can remap this input in the <code>Input (general)</code> menu of the Internal UI).

However, due to differences in the keyboard layouts (e.g. QWERTY vs. 
QWERTZ vs. AZERTY vs. Japanese vs. Russian and Bulgarian keyboards) and 
the possible presence of custom keys in the emulated system (e.g. the 
'Apple' command key in Macintosh, the 'CBM' key in Commodore computers 
etc.), it is tough to cover all the possibilities and to offer at the 
same time a nice interface for configurations.
<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> solution to 
this problem is to offer two different emulation modes for the keyboard 
of each system, Full and Partial, whenever you start the emulation of a 
computer (this does not apply to console). As said above, you can switch
 between the two using <kbd>ScrLock</kbd> (in (SDL)<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, the default key is <kbd>Delete</kbd> and you can change it in <a href="http://mess.redump.net/mess:mess.ini" class="wikilink1" title="mess:mess.ini">mess.ini</a> changing the <code>uimodekey</code> line).
</p>

<p>
(For more information on how to change this <kbd>ScrLock</kbd> to be something else, see: <a href="http://mess.redump.net/faq#for_some_reason_esc_does_not_quit_mess_nor_does_tab_bring_up_the_menu" class="urlextern" title="http://mess.redump.net/faq#for_some_reason_esc_does_not_quit_mess_nor_does_tab_bring_up_the_menu" rel="nofollow">http://mess.redump.net/faq#for_some_reason_esc_does_not_quit_mess_nor_does_tab_bring_up_the_menu</a>)
</p>

<p>
Below is a short description of the differences between the two modes.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="partial_emulation_mode" id="partial_emulation_mode">Partial Emulation Mode</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

In this emulation mode, you can access the UI keys described <a href="#key_functions" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">above</a> (e.g. <kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Esc</kbd>, <kbd>F4</kbd>, <kbd>F12</kbd>,
 etc.). Therefore, this suits your needs whenever you want to configure 
Inputs and Dip Switches, to take Screenshots, Movies or Savestates, or 
simply to quit emulation.
Notice that, anyway, inputs are registered also by the emulated system, 
so if you e.g. pause the emulation with <kbd>P</kbd> in Partial Emulation, a 'P' will appear on the emulated screen as well.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="full_emulation_mode" id="full_emulation_mode">Full Emulation Mode</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

In this emulation mode, the UI keys effect vanishes and each key on your
 keyboard corresponds to a key on the keyboard of the emulated computer.
Actually, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> offers two different flavours of Full Emulation: <strong>emulated</strong> and <strong>natural</strong>. You can switch between pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> and entering the <code>Keyboard Mode</code> menu.
</p>

</div>

<h5><a name="full_emulation_mode_with_emulated_keyboard_default_behaviour" id="full_emulation_mode_with_emulated_keyboard_default_behaviour">Full Emulation Mode with Emulated Keyboard (default behaviour)</a></h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>

By default <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> 
in Full Emulation mode tries to change your keyboard into the original 
keyboard. This way, all accessible keys of the original keyboard have a 
correspondent mappings on your keyboard, even the strangest function key
 that could have been present. Moreover, the default mapping tries to be
 as close as possible to the original one so that, if you were used to 
type without even looking at the keyboard on the real thing, you can do 
the same in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>!
However, this can produce a few strange situations when the original 
keyboard layout was very different from modern keyboards layout. As an 
example, you can think to Mattel Aquarius. In this computer the <kbd>Return</kbd> was at the right of the <kbd>. &gt;</kbd>, and therefore it defaults in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> to your  <kbd>/ ?</kbd> key. 
</p>

<p>
Even with this mapping quirks, sometimes it is still not really possible
 to remap the keyboard of an old computer to a modern keyboard. Hence, 
some of the following exceptions can happen:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> 'Spacebar', 'Backspace' and the 
arrow keys (when they have separate keys) are usually mapped to the 
correspondent keys of your keyboard;</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> when an emulated keyboard presents keys that are not on a modern pc keyboards, then <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> tries to map them to a closer key</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> character keys at left of '1' or between 'Shift' and 'Z' are often mapped to '~',</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> a third character key after '0' and 
'P' or a fourth one after 'L' and 'M' is often mapped to 'Backlash2' or 
to 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' etc.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

To be sure of the mapping of a keyboard in emulated mode, you can verify it in the <code>Input (this System)</code> menu of the Internal UI. In this menu, you can also remap every key to the location you prefer on your keyboard.
</p>

</div>

<h5><a name="full_emulation_mode_with_natural_keyboard" id="full_emulation_mode_with_natural_keyboard">Full Emulation Mode with Natural Keyboard</a></h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>

This mode can be activated launching <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> with the <code>-natural</code> option or by entering the Internal UI and choosing the <code>Keyboard Mode</code> menu. When you select the Natural Keyboard mode, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> translates the key you press in the same exact key of the original keyboard, so that when you press e.g. <kbd>+</kbd>
 you will see on screen a plus sign, no matter where that key was 
located on the original system, or if a key combination was needed to 
access it. Or, again, if you press arrow keys while emulating a Spectrum
 48k, you will see the cursor move in the corresponding directions even 
if you should have used <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>5</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>6</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>7</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>8</kbd> to obtain the same result on a real Spectrum keyboard. This makes typing much easier but it presents a couple of limitations:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> many custom key have no equivalent 
on modern pc keyboards: in this case, you may want to switch between 
Natural and Emulated mode when you need such keys</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> some UTF-8 characters are not present on every keyboard (e.g. £, ¥, §, π etc.): in this case, usually <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 maps them to the corresponding keys and if you don't have them on your 
keyboard, you shall switch to Emulated mode when you need it.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Notice that the Natural Keyboard cannot be remapped.
</p>

</div>

<p>

A few experiments combining the three modes, and a bit of time spent 
configuring the keys you use most, shall allow you to recreate a perfect
 experience of the emulated system.
However, if you experience any problem, or if you think any important 
key is still unmapped, please file a bug report in <a href="http://bugzilla.mess.org/" class="urlextern" title="http://bugzilla.mess.org/" rel="nofollow">Bugzilla</a> or contact us at the <a href="http://www.bannister.org/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&amp;Board=1&amp;page=1" class="urlextern" title="http://www.bannister.org/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&amp;Board=1&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">MESS message board</a>.

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> supports tapes for a huge number of systems. Typical tape format for <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 is plain .wav: at loading time, any other tape format is internally 
converted to .wav and if you save any program to tape, you will obtain a
 .wav file.
</p>

<p>
To load a tape in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you simply need to use the <code>-cass</code> option (for systems with many cassette drive, you use <code>-cass1</code> or <code>-cass2</code> respectively):

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe &lt;system&gt; -cass foo.ext</pre>

<p>

Cassette loading is in general not automatic, except if it was on the 
original system. This means that you may need to enter CLOAD or LOAD or 
another command and then to press “Play” on the cassette drive. To press
 “Play” in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you simply need to enter the Internal UI, choose the <code>Tape Controls</code> menu and press “Play”. The same procedure goes for any other tape operation (“Rec”, “Stop”, etc.).
</p>

<p>
To remove a tape in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> or to replace it with a new one, while the emulation is running, you simply need to enter the Internal UI, choose the <code>File Manager</code> menu, select <code>Cassette</code>
 and click on the tape file you are currently using. This shall prompt 
you with a file browser which allows you either to change tape image or 
to select “empty slot” to remove completely the tape file from the 
cassette drive.
</p>

<p>
In the same file browser you can also choose to create a brand new 
cassette, choosing “Create”. In this case you have to enter a name and 
then a new wav file will be created, from the cassette drive. This is 
very useful when you want to save data or programs to a cassette. Again,
 the saving procedure is not automatic, except if it was on the original
 system, and you need to know the correct commands used by the emulated 
machine. At the end, you will find a .wav file in your <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> directory containing the data you wanted to save.
</p>

<p>
Notice that loading and saving procedures can be slow. However, you can speed up emulation with no bad consequences by pressing <kbd>Ins</kbd> in partial keyboard emulation mode.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Tips</strong> - <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> supports also a faster way to create a new tape file: from command line launch <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> with a non-existent .wav file

 and click on the quickload file you are currently using. This shall 
prompt you with a file browser which allows you either to change 
quickload file or to select “empty slot” to remove completely the 
quickload file from the memory.
</p>

<p>
No saving to quickload is implemented in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>,
 nor it is planned addition of this. Saving memory contents can be 
already done in systems which supports State Saving, and other systems 
should add support for Save States rather than for Quicksave.

<p>

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> supports CD-ROM for a few systems. Typical tape format for <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> is CHD. You can read a guide about how to create a CHD from a CD <a href="http://guru.mameworld.info/tutorials/dumping_cds_&amp;_hdds/index.html" class="urlextern" title="http://guru.mameworld.info/tutorials/dumping_cds_&amp;_hdds/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, courtesy of The Guru. 
To load a CD-ROM in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you simply need to use the <code>-cdrom</code> option

</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe &lt;system&gt; -cdrom foo.chd</pre>

<p>

CD-ROM loading is automatic once the emulation is started.
</p>

<p>
To remove a CD-ROM in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> or to replace it with a new one, while the emulation is running, you simply need to enter the Internal UI, choose the <code>File Manager</code> menu, select <code>Cdrom</code>
 and click on the CHD file you are currently using. This shall prompt 
you with a file browser which allows you either to change CD-ROM image 
or to select “empty slot” to remove completely the CD-ROM file from the 
CD-ROM drive.

<p>

Sometimes, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> supports more BIOS dumps for a single system, e.g. to offer access to different <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym> revisions. To select among these, you can use the <code>-bios</code> option at launch. A list of available bios and related options for each system is available in <a href="http://mess.redump.net/sysinfo" class="wikilink1" title="sysinfo">sysinfo.dat</a>.

<h1><a name="internal_ui_options" id="internal_ui_options">Internal UI Options</a></h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>

During emulation in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you can always press <kbd>Tab</kbd>
 to access the Internal UI and customize all the options you can need to
 fully enjoy your experience. This Internal UI works very similarly to <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym> one (with a few additional items, as you will notice below). Hence, if you are used to <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>, you will immediately recognize what you need here.
</p>

<p>
Before passing to analyze each submenu of the Internal UI, please 
remember that if you enter the wrong submenu, you can always press <kbd>Esc</kbd> or scroll down to <code>Return to Prior Menu</code> to go back.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="input_general" id="input_general">Input (general)</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Exactly as in <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>,
 in this menu you can configure the UI controls and the common Inputs 
which will be shared by all the systems, e.g. the “Pause” key (by 
default mapped to <kbd>P</kbd>), the Snapshot key (by default mapped to <kbd>F12</kbd>) or the joypad/joystick buttons (e.g. Button 1 to 4 by default mapped to <kbd>LCtrl</kbd>, <kbd>LAlt</kbd>, <kbd>Space</kbd> &amp; <kbd>LShift</kbd> as in <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>). 
</p>

<p>
Notice that you must be careful when selecting the keys you want to use:
 they may be already in use for other functions.
 
The options changed in this menu will be saved in cfg/default.cfg (which
 can be opened with any text editor) and will affect every emulated 
system. If you end up setting something wrong and the emulation does not
 work anymore as you expect, <strong>DON'T PANIC!</strong> You simply 
need to delete the default.cfg file from the cfg/ directory, in order to
 reset the settings to their default value. Every change can always be 
reverted in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>!
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="input_this_system" id="input_this_system">Input (this System)</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Exactly as in <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>,
 in this menu you can configure the Inputs which are system specific, 
e.g. the computer keyboards, or joypad/joystick buttons (e.g. Button 1 
to 4 by default mapped to <kbd>LCtrl</kbd>, <kbd>LAlt</kbd>, <kbd>Space</kbd> &amp; <kbd>LShift</kbd> as in <acronym title="Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator">MAME</acronym>). 
</p>

<p>
All you need to do now is to select the function you want to change, 
press enter and then press the key you want to use. It is possible to 
assign more than one key to a function by pressing enter again and 
pressing a different key.
More fancy key combinations can be made as well:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> To map <kbd>Key1</kbd> OR <kbd>Key2</kbd> (i.e. more than one key will produce the same effect), set one of the keys as before, wait until <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> accepts it, then repeat for second key.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> To map <kbd>Key1</kbd> AND <kbd>Key2</kbd> (i.e. you need to press to keys at the same time to obtain an effect) press both (or more than two) keys after pressing enter.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> To map <kbd>Key1</kbd> NOT <kbd>Key2</kbd> (i.e. <kbd>Key1</kbd> has an effect only if <kbd>Key2</kbd>
 is not also pressed), select the function you want to change, press 
enter, press the first key and then quickly press the second key(s) 
twice.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

The correspondent combination will appear on screen and you can check if the result is the one you wanted to obtain.
</p>

<p>
Notice that you must be careful when selecting the keys you want to use:
 they may be already in use for other functions.
If you want to assign joystick movements to a function then once you 
have selected the function you want to change move the joystick/pad or 
press the fire button you want to use (remember that, as explained 
above, you must have selected the <code>-joystick</code> option to activate the Joystick support if you want it to work in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>).

 
The options changed in this menu will be saved in cfg/&lt;system&gt;.cfg
 (which can be opened with any text editor) and will affect only the 
chosen system and (possibly) its clones. If you end up setting something
 wrong and the emulation does not work anymore as you expect, <strong>DON'T PANIC!</strong>
 You simply need to delete the corresponding .cfg file from the cfg/ 
directory, in order to reset the settings to their default value. Every 
change can always be reverted in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>!

<p>

Here, for systems which support them, you can choose between different 
emulated controllers. Changing a setting in this menu, corresponds in 
some sense to unplug a controller from a controller port of the original
 system and to plug a new one into it. 
As an example, consider Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) which allows
 you to choose between a normal controller, a Zapper lightgun and an 
Arkanoid paddle in the <code>Category Menu</code>. Corresponding re-mappable inputs will appear in the <code>Input (this System)</code> menu after your choice here.

<h4><a name="analog_controls" id="analog_controls">Analog Controls</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Here you can configure all the analog controls available for the system 
you're emulating (e.g. emulated mouses, paddles or lightguns). Many 
choices are given in this menu: you can make the controller more or less
 sensible in each direction, or invert the axis, to better suit your 
needs.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="system_information" id="system_information">System Information</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Here you can see some basic info about the system you're emulating 
(which system is, what CPU it used etc.). It simply shows you again the 
information screen that <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> had already showed at start.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="image_information" id="image_information">Image Information</a></h4>

Here, you can see which image is currently loaded in each available device.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="file_manager" id="file_manager">File Manager</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Here, you can mount an image in one of the available media devices, or 
unmount the image currently loaded and mount a new one in the same media
 device or in a different one. This menu also allows you to create new 
images for devices which supports image creation and saving (e.g. 
cassette). You simply have to select the device, and then the “Create” 
option. You will be asked to type in a filename and then the new image 
will be created (if there exists already a file with the same name, you 
will be asked if you want to overwrite the old one or to change 
filename).
</p>

<p>
Notice that, once you have selected the device you want to modify, the 
File Manager will allow you to browse every volume and directory of your
 computer and to select the file you want. Moreover, the File Manager 
allows you to use <kbd>PgUp</kbd>, <kbd>PgDn</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> for a faster scroll and to input the first letters of the file you look for in order to reach immediately the image you want.
</p>

<p>
And if you want to load an image from the available software lists, you 
can do that as well by selecting the correspondent menu entry (more info
 on this topic can be found in the <a href="#software_lists" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Software List</a> Section of this Manual).
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="keyboard_mode" id="keyboard_mode">Keyboard Mode</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Here, you can select in real time the keyboard emulation mode you 
prefer, between “Full Emulation Mode with Emulated Keyboard ” (emulated)
 or “Full Emulation Mode with Natural Keyboard” (natural). See <a href="#emulated_keyboard" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Emulated Keyboard</a> section of this Manual for more information about these two modes.

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> let you 
customize brightness, contrast and gamma parameters. You can change 
these values in many different ways. They are present in the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>,
 so you can tweak them before starting emulation. Alternatively, you can
 modify them in real time by entering the Internal UI (press <kbd>Tab</kbd>) and selecting the <code>Slider Controls</code> menu (see also the <a href="#internal_ui_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Internal UI</a> section).

</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="brightness" id="brightness">-brightness</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> allows you to choose also different video configurations, to improve compatibility with older video card. These settings are <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym>-depending.
</p>

<p>
If you are using <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> for Windows, you can select
</p>
<pre class="code">-video d3d
-video ddraw
-video gdi</pre>

<p>

D3D is the fastest setting, but it requires a Direct 3D 8+ compatible 
graphics card. If your card is not compatible with latest Direct 3D, you
 may want to try ddraw or gdi.
</p>

<p>
You can also select which version of Direct 3D libraries to use, by setting the <code>-d3dversion</code> options. You can only choose between 8 and 9 (corresponding to Direct 3D 8 and Direct 3D 9), 9 being the default. 
</p>

<p>
If you are using (SDL)<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you can select
</p>
<pre class="code">-video opengl
-video soft</pre>

<p>
OpenGL is the fastest setting, but it requires a OpenGL compatible 
graphics card and drivers. Alternatively, you can choose the slower but 
also more compatible soft rendering.
You can also select to use your own alternative GL library by setting
 -gl_lib /path/to/libGL.so
and select which SDL video drivers to use, by setting the <code>-videodriver </code> option to “x11”, “directfb”, etc. or to “auto” which uses the SDL default.
</p>

<p>
In every operating system, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> also offers the option <code>-video none</code>
 which doesn't output anything on screen. This is very useful for 
benchmarking because it takes away any possible slowdown due to the 
graphics card.

<div class="level2">

<p>

You can force <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> to keep the aspect ratio of the emulated system despite any resizing of the window by using <code>-keepaspect </code>.
 In full screen mode, this will make black borders to appear to 
compensate your screen size vs. emulated screen size. If you turn this 
off (with <code>-nokeepaspect</code>), the emulated screen will be stretched to fill the whole window/full screen.
</p>

<p>
Also you can decide to scale the system graphics before displaying it. This can be done by using the option <code>-prescale &lt;n&gt;</code> with “n” an integer number (“1” is the defualt value)
</p>

<p>
(SDL)<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> also offers a few more scaling options, when in 'soft' video mode (see <a href="#video_modes" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">Video Modes</a> section above). These can be selected by setting <code>-scalemode</code> to <code>async</code>, <code>yv12</code>, <code>yuy2</code>, <code>yv12x2</code>, <code>yuy2x2</code> or “none” (default value).

The simple fact is, if Windows supports your joystick or gamepad and it 
has been set up properly in the Windows Control Panel, there shouldn't 
be an issue with <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> supporting it.
If you haven't configured your controller, then open the <code>Start → Settings → Control Panel</code>
 window. In Windows 2000 and XP you will have a system Controllers icon.
 You'll have to refer to the Windows help file to configure your 
controller, but make sure that the main controller is “Joystick 1”.
</p>

<p>
A similar situation holds true for (SDL)<acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>: if the SDL libraries recognize your controllers, the emulator will recognize them as well!

<p>

The <code>-joystick_map</code> option allows to control how joystick values map to digital joystick controls. <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 accepts all joystick input from the system as analog data. For true 
analog joysticks, this needs to be mapped down to the usual 4-way or 
8-way digital joystick values. To do this, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 divides the analog range into a 9×9 grid. It then takes the joystick 
axis position (for X and Y axes only), maps it to this grid, and then 
looks up a translation from a joystick map. This parameter allows you to
 specify the map. The default is 'auto', which means that a standard 
8-way, 4-way, or 4-way diagonal map is selected automatically based on 
the input port configuration of the current game.
Maps are defined as a string of numbers and characters. Since the grid 
is 9×9, there are a total of 81 characters necessary to define a 
complete map. Below is an example map for an 8-way joystick:
</p>
<pre class="code">777888999 Note that the numeric digits correspond to the keys 
777888999 on a numeric keypad. So '7' maps to up+left, '4' maps 
777888999 to left, '5' maps to neutral, etc. In addition to the 
444555666 numeric values, you can specify the character 's', 
444555666 which means "sticky". In this case, the value of the 
444555666 map is the same as it was the last time a non-sticky 
111222333 value was read. 
111222333 
111222333 </pre>

<p>
To specify the map for this option, you can specify a string of rows 
separated by a ”.” (which indicates the end of a row), like so
</p>
<pre class="code">777888999.777888999.777888999.444555666.444555666.444555666.111222333.111222333.111222333  </pre>

<p>
However, this can be reduced using several shorthands supported by the 
&lt;map&gt; parameter. If information about a row is missing, then it is
  assumed that any missing data in columns 5-9 are left/right symmetric 
with data in columns 0-4; and any missing data in colums 0-4 is  assumed
 to be copies of the previous data. The same logic applies to missing 
rows, except that up/down symmetry is assumed.  By using these 
shorthands, the 81 character map can be simply specified by this 11 
character string: <code>7778…4445</code>  Looking at the first row, <code>7778</code>
 is only 4 characters long. The 5th entry can't use symmetry, so it is 
assumed to be equal to the previous character '8'. The 6th character is 
left/right symmetric with the 4th character, giving an '8'. The 7th 
character is left/right symmetric with the 3rd character, giving a '9' 
(which is '7' with left/right flipped). Eventually this gives the full <code>777888999</code>
 string of the row.  The second and third rows are missing, so they are 
assumed to be identical to the first row. The fourth row decodes 
similarly to the first row, producing <code>444555666</code>. The fifth 
row is missing so it is assumed to be the same as the fourth.  The 
remaining three rows are also missing, so they are assumed to be the 
up/down mirrors of the first three rows, giving three final rows of <code>111222333</code>.

<p>

To save a snapshot (a.k.a. screenshot) of an emulated system in <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>, you simply have to press <kbd>F12</kbd> during emulation. The image will be saved in .png format in the snap/ directory. 
The user can customize the resolution of the snapshot through the option <code>-snapsize</code> (either at command line or in mess.ini or in the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>).
 Also, for games with an artwork, the user can decide if the artwork 
must be included or not in the png. This can be chosen by using the 
option <code>-snapview</code>. E.g. for pc1403 setting the default option
</p>
<pre class="code">-snapview internal</pre>

<p>
will produce a snapshot also including the artwork. Setting
</p>
<pre class="code">-snapview "Standard (4:3)"</pre>

<p>
will produce a snapshot without the artwork (only the digit display on a black background). The <code>-snapview</code> setting needed to exclude the artwork can be found in the <code>Video Options</code> menu of the Internal UI, since its name corresponds to the View Settings which turn off the artwork.
</p>

<p>
Remeber that, by default, the snapshot is saved with a progressive number into a subfolder named system/ (which <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> creates if there is none). 
In other words, if you take a snap of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym>
 running pce emulation, you will find a .png file as follows 
“snap/pce/0000.png”
Following snapshots will be named in progressive order “0001.png”, 
“0002.png” etc. However, the naming rules can be partially modified by 
the user, as described in <a href="#snapshot_naming_options" title="mess:howto ↵" class="wikilink1">next entry</a>.
</p>

<p>

<em>TO DO: Better explain the views and stress that they are the same 
ones used in the -view command and that they can be found by loading a 
game, pressing tab, selecting video options and checking out the views 
in the list. The view used can also be different from the one you've got
 displayed.</em>

<h2><a name="snapshot_naming_options" id="snapshot_naming_options">Snapshot Naming Options</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

To customize the way snapshots are saved in the snap/ folder, <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> offers the option <code>-snapname</code>. As of <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> 0.142, you can choose various combinations of the following templates
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <code>/</code> = path separator</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <code>%g</code> = system name</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <code>%i</code> = index</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <code>%d_XXXX</code> = device <code>XXXX</code> (<code>XXXX</code> being the brief name of a media device)</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

As an example, 
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe adam -snapname %g</pre>

<p>
will save your first Coleco Adam snap as “adam.png” inside the snap/ 
folder, and then it will overwrite it whenever you press again <kbd>F12</kbd>. On the other hand,
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe adam -snapname %g%i</pre>

<p>
will save snapshots in the snap/ directory with progressive names “adam0000.png”, “adam0001.png”, etc. The default setting is
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe adam -snapname %g/%i</pre>

<p>
which produces a subfolder named adam/ which will contain all snapshots,
 and the snaps will be named as “0000.png”, “0001.png”, etc.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, starting from <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> 0.142, it is possible to use the <code>%d_XXXX</code> template to name snaps after the name of the software file mounted in the media device <code>XXXX</code>.
 E.g. you can use ”-snapname %d_cart” to use the name of the game  
mounted in the cartslot, or ”-snapname %d_flop2” to use the name of the 
program mounted in the second floppy drive, or ”-snapname %d_hard1” to 
use the name of the hard disk mounted in the first HD drive, etc. 
Remember that you can find out which media device are supported by each 
system by using the <code>-listmedia</code> option.
</p>

<p>
If you are loading by fullpath, e.g.
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe nes -cart "Super Mario.nes" -snapname %d_cart</pre>

<p>
pressing <kbd>F12</kbd> will create a “Super Mario.png” file in the 
snap/ directory. While if you are loading through software lists, then 
its shortname will be used, e.g.
</p>
<pre class="code">mess.exe nes -cart smb -snapname %d_cart</pre>

<p>
will result in a “smb.png” file in the snap/ directory.
</p>

<p>
Of course, any combination of the <code>%d_xxxx</code> template with the old <code>/</code>, <code>%g</code> and <code>%i</code> templates is supported as well.
</p>

<p>
Notice that if you specify an invalid -snapname template, or if you specify an invalid device (like <code>%d_cass</code> for a system without tape support), or if you have no software mounted in the chosen media device, then <acronym title="Multi Emulator Super System">MESS</acronym> will revert to the default template <code>%g/%i</code>.
