<h1>Installing MESS</h1>
<p class="normal">This section deals with installing the MESS application. It includes where you can get MESS from, where to put it and what to
expect when you extract it.</p>
<br />
<hr />
<h2>Download and uncompress MESS</h2>
<p class="normal">Download the latest Windows version of MESS from the homepage <a href="http://www.mess.org" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p class="normal">Unzip the file into a directory of your choice. MESS is distributed in a ZIP file format so depending on what version of Windows
you have you may need a tool like <a href="http://www.winzip.com" target="_blank">Winzip</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>MESS folders and files</h2>
<p class="normal">When you have uncompressed the ZIP file you should see some folders and a few other files. Here is an example of what MESS version
0.105 (mess0105b.zip) looks like once it is uncompressed (actually some of them could appear after you run MESS the first time). The latest version 
should be similar. However, if any folder is missing, and you need it, you can simply create it and MESS will use it as described below.</p>
