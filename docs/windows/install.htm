			<h1>Installing MESS</h1>
			<p class="normal">This section deals with installing and updating MESS. It 
				includes where you can get MESS from, where to put it and what to expect when 
				you extract it.
			</p>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<h2>
			Where to get MESS</h2>
			<p class="normal">You can get MESS from its homepage <a href="http://www.mess.org" target="_blank">
					here</a>. Make sure that you only download the Win32 version as that's the 
				Windows version.</p>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<p class="normal">You need to get yourself a copy of <a href="http://www.winzip.com" target="_blank" onFocus="if(this.blur)this.blur()">
					Winzip</a>
			. Just click the link to download it!
			<p class="normal">
			Once you've installed Winzip, right click over the MESS zip file and select 
			"extract to ...".
			<p class="Tutorial" align="center"><img src="images/wzip.gif" width="144" height="100" border="1" name="Extract">
			<p class="normal">
			In the box that appears use the directory "C:\MESS" and then press the 
			"Extract" button.
			<p class="normal">
			Winzip will now extract both MESS and MESS32 as they are both contained in the 
			same zip file. Beware though because if you have different versions (e.g. 0.71 
			and 0.72) of MESS in the same directory then some roms that have changed in the 
			new version will not work on the older version.
			<p>&nbsp;
				<hr>
			<h2>Creating A Desktop Shortcut</h2>
			<p class="normal">
			Here is how you can make a shortcut icon on your desktop. The simplest way of 
			doing this is to find the MESS GUI file in the C:\MESS directory, right click 
			on it, select "Send To.." and then select Desktop. If this is successful you 
			will see the icon on your desktop. Next right click on your new icon and select 
			properties from the menu. Click the &quot;Shortcut&quot; tab and in the 
			&quot;Start In&quot; box type c:\MESS, press OK and that's it.
			<p>&nbsp;
				<hr>
				
			<h2>What You Should See In Your MESS Folder!</h2>
			
			<p class="normal">
			Here is a picture of the folders that are created once you've extracted MESS . 
			Check in Windows Explorer if you are unsure whether you have followed above 
			correctly.
			<p class="normal" align="center"><img src="images/tree.gif" width="111" height="255" border="2" name="Folders">
			<p class="normal">
			Below is a brief explanation of what can be found or put in each folder.
