			<h1>On-Screen Menus</h1>
			<p class="normal">This page deals with the on-screen menus in MESS. It covers 
				both the original and the new user interface.<br>
			</p>
			<hr width="95%">
			<h2>Original Interface</p>
            </h2>
			<p class="normal">MESS being based on Mame shares the same on-screen menu system 
				with obviously a few differences.
			</p>
			<p class="normal">Firstly you need to press the Scroll Lock key to get MESS to 
				switch to partial keyboard emulation. Then press the TAB key to open the menu. 
				Here's what you get...</p>
			<p align="center" class="Tutorial"><img src="images/oldmenu.gif" width="293" height="262"></p>
			<p class="normal">The Input menus cover the keys used by the MESS user interface 
				and the keys used in the system loaded. In these menus you can change the keys 
				to ones you more prefer.</p>
			<p class="normal">Dip Switches set the internal switches used on systems. For 
				example the 1/2 player switch in the Atari 2600 is classed as a dip switch.</p>
			<p class="normal">Analog controls help you set up paddle and analog controllers 
				in MESS.</p>
			<p class="normal">Image Information gives details about the loaded software if 
				MESS has it.</p>
			<p class="normal">File manager is where you can load software into MESS.</p>
			<p class="normal">Machine usage and history gives details about the system loaded 
				and how many time you've used it.</p>
			<p class="normal">Reset machine resets the loaded system which is useful if you 
				have changes dip switches or want to load other software.</p>
			<p class="normal">Once done go to return to the machine and press the Scroll Lock 
				key to change back to full keyboard emulation.<br>
			</p>
			<hr align="center" width="95%">
			<h2>New User Interface</p>
            </h2>
			<p class="normal">Unlike Mame, MESS can use windows to display its menu system 
				which makes things a bit easier. Here's what it looks like...</p>
			<p align="center" class="Tutorial"><img src="images/newmenu.gif" width="293" height="282"></p>
