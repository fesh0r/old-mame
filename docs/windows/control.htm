			<h1>Controls</h1>
			<p class="normal">This section gives you the basic keys used in MESS. You will 
				find a keymap for MESS and more importantly how to find and change the keys 
				used for different systems. Finally you'll see how to configure your system to 
				use a joystick and running systems using a joystick or mouse.

			<p class="normal">
			These are the default keys found in MESS. You can find out the system keys by 
			pressing the &quot;Tab&quot; key during a system and selecting &quot;Input 
			(this system)&quot;.
			<p class="normal">&nbsp;
				<hr>
			<h2>Changing The Default Keys</h2>
			<p class="normal">
			To change the system control keys simply run the system you want to play. Once 
			the system has loaded press the "Tab" key to open the in-system menu and 
			highlight "Input (this system)". Press enter and you will see this screen...
			<p align="center" class="Tutorial"><img alt="easyEmu!" src="images/keybcnt.gif" width="293" height="262">
			<p class="normal">
			All you need to do now is to select the function you want to change, press 
			enter and then press the key you want to use. It is possible to assign more 
			than one key to a function by pressing enter again and pressing a different 
			key.
			<p class="normal">
			You must be careful when selecting the keys you want to use as they may be in 
			use by other functions.
			<p class="normal">
			If you want to assign joystick movements to a function then once you have 
			selected the function you want to change move the joystick/pad or press the 
			fire button you want to use. (N.B. You must have the <span class="command">-joystick</span> option used for 
			the command line versions of MESS or Use Joystick selected in the MESS32 
			configuration)
			<p class="normal">&nbsp;
				<hr>
			
			<h2>
			If Things Go Wrong!</h2>
			
			<p class="normal">
			If you muck up your system keys and want to reset them to default then open the 
			C:\MESS\Cfg folder and delete the relevant .cfg file for the system. If for 
			some insane reason you change the default MESS keys and can't get back into the 
			in-system menu then you will need to delete the default.cfg file from the same 
			folder as before.
			<p class="normal">&nbsp;
				<hr>
				
			<h2>Configuring Joysticks</h2>
			<p class="normal">
			The simple fact is, if Windows supports your joystick or gampad and it has been 
			set up properly in the windows control panel, there shouldn't be an issue with 
			MESS supporting it.
			<p class="normal">
			If you haven't configured your controller then open the 
			Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;Control Panel window. You'll see one of two things in 
			Windows 95 there'll be a joystick icon, 98/2000 and XP will have a system 
			Controllers icon. You'll have to refer to the Windows help file to configure 
			your controller (as I can't remember how to do it on 9x) but make sure that the 
			main controller is Joystick 1.

			<h2>Using Joysticks &amp; Mice</h2>
			
			<p class="normal">
			MESS W32 needs the -joystick option in its command line and MESS GUI will need 
			the &quot;Use Joystick&quot; option selected in its configuration window.
			<p><span class="Tutorial">MESS also supports the mouse. As usual the command line 
  versions of MESS will need the -mouse option and MESS GUI will need the &quot;Use 
  Mouse&quot; option selected in it's config window.</span>
