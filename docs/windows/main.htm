		<h1>MESS (Multi Emulator Super System)</h1>
		<p>Copyright © 1998-2006, The MESS team</p>
		<p class="normal">Welcome to the MESS guide. In this guide you will find everything 
			you need to get this fantastic emulator running.</p>
		<p class="normal">MESS is to computers and consoles as MAME is to arcade machines. 
			i.e. It is an attempt to exactly emulate early computer and console systems. It 
			is based primarily on the MAME source code so versions run in parallel to MAME.</p>
		<p class="normal">The reason MESS can use MAME as a basis is that most chips in 
			computers and consoles are direct copies of arcade chips just connected a 
			different way.&nbsp; In the guide you need to be aware of some terminology. If 
			I use the word system it means the computer or console system being emulated. 
			If I use the word BIOS it is meant to be for system roms or BIOS images used to 
			get MESS working. Finally if I use the word software it means the rom/tape/disk 
			etc... image to be loaded onto the system running in MESS.</p>
		<h2>How to use this manual</h2>
		<p class="normal">
			Remember, when you type commands into the command prompt, you should avoid 
			making typos
			<span class="fixedsize">;-)</span>
			In this how-to, filenames and other static text are marked with the color
			<span class="filename">
					brown</span>
			and command lines or other information that you need to type in are marked with 
			the color
			<span class="command">green</span>
		</p>
		<h2>Manual Credits</h2>
		<p>This manual is largely based on the easyEmu guides by Paul Vince.&nbsp; The 
			"Compiling MESS" document was based on the Compiling MAME document at the MAME 
			website.&nbsp; The FAQ has been largely written by Justin and That70sguy.</p>
		<p>All trademarks cited in this document are property of their respective owners. 
			Especially, the MESS team would like to thank Nicola Salmoria and the MAME team 
			for letting us play with their code and, in fact, incorporating MESS specific 
			code into MAME. Without it, MESS would be substantially less than what it is 
			right now! ;-)</p>
