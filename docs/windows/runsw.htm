			<h1>Running Software</h1>
			<p class="normal">On this page you'll find a quick guide on how to run software 
				in MESS. Most of this is covered in the other pages but this should make things 
				simpler.<br>
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>
				First Things</p>
            </h2>
			<p class="normal">You need to make sure you've done a few things before running 
				MESS. First you need the systems BIOS zip file in the C:\MESS\bios folder. 
				Secondly if you want to run software it needs to be in the C:\MESS\software\<em>&lt;system_name&gt;</em>
				folder where <em>&lt;system_name&gt;</em> is the name of the system you want to 
				run.<br>
			</p>
			<hr align="center" width="95%">
			<h2>Quick start (Command Line)</p>
            </h2>
			<p class="normal">To run the command line version of MESS you need to do to open 
				a command prompt. Either go to the start button, press run and type <em>command</em>
				or you can run the command prompt from the start/programs/accessories menu.
			</p>
			<p class="normal">
			Once you are in a DOS box type in this command
			<p align="center"><span class="command">cd C:\MESS</span>
			<p class="normal">
			You should see the prompt
			<p align="center"><span class="command">C:\MESS&gt;</span>
			<p class="normal">
			MESS for Win32 uses a straightforward command format to execute. Heres what it 
			looks like...
			<p align="center" class="Tutorial">
				<span class="command">MESS &lt;system&gt; 
  &lt;device&gt; &lt;software_name&gt; -options</span>
			<p class="normal">
			Heres an example of running MESS at the command line...
			<p align="center"><span class="command">MESS a2600 -cart defender.a26 -now</span></p>
			<p class="normal">This will run defender on an Atari 2600 using the full screen.
			</p>
			<p class="normal">As you can see it's not too hard. Use the <a href="messw32command.htm" target="_blank">
					MESS W32 Commands</a> page for info on options and system names can be 
				found on the <a href="messsuppsys.htm" target="_blank">Supported Systems</a> page.</p>
			<p class="normal">If your brain is easily frazzled and you want an easier MESS 
				use the GUI version as it's much easier to configure.<br>
			</p>
			<hr align="center" width="95%">
			<h2>Quick Start (MESS GUI)</p>
            </h2>
			<p class="normal">Open the MESS GUI and you'll see something like this...</p>
			<p align="center" class="Tutorial"><img src="images/gui.gif" width="550" height="481"></p>
			<p class="normal">All you need to do to run systems is to double click an icon in 
				the first list. However MESS may say that software needs to be present to load 
				the system. Therefore once you've installed some software just double click it 
				from the second list and it will load. That's It!
