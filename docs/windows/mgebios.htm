			<h2>Updating BIOS files</p>
            </h2>
			<p class="normal">
			As new versions of MESS come out, the authors sometimes change system the bios 
			files in order to make them work properly. As a by-product of this you can 
			sometimes have to update several files.
			<p class="normal">The simplest way is to use a rom manager such as CLRMame Pro 
				with a MESS Bios DATFile as it will identify problems and fix alot of them too. 
			<p class="normal">One of the best sites to visit after an update to MESS is <a href="" target="_blank" http://www.sys2064.com/">
					MESS BIOS Files</a> as it will normally have all the updates. To install 
				these updates all you need to do is download the files and copy them into the 
				<span class="filename">C:\MESS\bios</span> folder.

			<h2><br>
			Verifying BIOS Files
            </h2>
			<p class="normal">
			You can let the command line version of MESS audit it's own BIOS files using 
			this command...
			<p align="center">
				<span class="command">MESS -verifyroms &gt;missing.txt </span>
			<p class="normal">
			This will generate a text file that contains information about all the BIOS 
			files you have problems with and what the problem is.
			<p class="normal">
			For MESS GUI its far easier. On the File menu there is an option called Audit 
			System Roms. If you hit it this window opens...
			<p align="center" class="Tutorial"><img src="images/guiaudit.gif" width="437" height="339" border="0">
			<p class="normal">
			The list is shows is the same as the one generated by the command line version 
			and again shows all of the errors in your rom files. The only errors that can 
			be resolved in the list are &quot;NOT FOUND&quot; and &quot;CRC ERROR&quot; as 
			the other errors normally mean there has been a problem during the extraction 
			of the rom from the arcade board.
			<p class="normal">If a system has stopped working after an update and you can't 
				find anything wrong with the zip file then either there could be a bug in MESS 
				or there has been new development on the game driver. The mess.txt file 
				contains a list of working and non-working systems and is a good start. If this 
				is no good then you can check out the <a href="http://bugzilla.mess.org/" target="_blank">
					MESS Bugzilla</a>
			page and see if any news has been posted about it.
			<p class="normal">
			Always make sure you scan your BIOS files with a rom management utility after 
			an update to make sure your set is correct.
