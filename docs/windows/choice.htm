<h2><font size="6">Choosing which MESS</font></h2>
<p class="normal">MESS for Windows comes in two flavors; a command line MESS and a MESS GUI.</p>
<hr />

<h2>Original Command Line MESS</h2>

<p class="normal">Firstly for all you newbies, a command line program requires you to type in a command using the keyboard to make a program start.
There is no mouse, little help and no lovely buttons to show you what you're doing. So beware this is not for the PC illiterate.</p>

<p class="normal">However, if you want to give it a try, you can start MESS by simply typing <span class="command">mess system [devices]
 [options]</span>, where</p>
<table width="58%" border="1" align="center">
<tr>
<td width="15%" class="tablehead">system</td>
<td width="85%" class="normal">is the system you want to emulate in MESS.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="15%" class="tablehead">devices</td>
<td width="85%" class="normal">is the optional list of devices supported by 'system' that you want to fill with an image (e.g. carts for a console or 
floppies for an home computer) and the name of the image you want to load in each device. To know which devices are supported, you can launch <span 
class="command">mess system -listmedia</span>. Notice that some systems require images in a device to start (e.g. tipically cartridges in a console)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="15%" class="tablehead">options</td>
<td width="85%" class="normal">is a list of additional MESS options (e.g. to run MESS in a window, to change the font of the internal UI, or to add .png 
filters to the image). To know which devices are supported, you can simply launch <span class="command">mess -showusage</span>.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="normal">Here is an example of how to run a command line MESS:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/command.gif" width="461" height="163" border="1" /></p>

<p class="normal">This will run the Atari 2600 cartridge of Frogger using a 3D card like this:</p>

<p align="center" class="Tutorial"><img src="images/frog.gif" width="293" height="282" /></p>

<p class="normal">Notice that in this example: system is 'a2600', devices is '-cart frogger.a26' (here this is mandatory: a2600 would not run without 
a cart inserted) and options is '-d3d'</p>

<p class="normal">For a complete introduction to command line MESS, please refer to the <a href="win32cmd.htm" target="_blank">MESS W32 Commands</a> page.

<h2>MESS GUI</h2>

<p class="normal">The easiest version of MESS is MESS GUI (Graphical User Interface) which has a user friendly point and click interface . This
version is more suited for the beginner as you can see everything that you are doing.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/gui.gif" width="593" height="432" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="normal">It has all of the features of MESS and runs just as fast. The best part is that you have a nice list of all the systems and games
you have, you can have preview pictures of your games and to run then you simply need to double click them.</p>
