        <h2><font size="6">Choosing which MESS</font></h2>
		<p class="normal">
        MESS for Windows comes in two flavors; a command line MESS and a MESS
        GUI.
			<hr>
		<h2>Original Command Line MESS</h2>
		
		<p class="normal">
		Firstly for all you newbies, a command line program requires you to type in a 
		command using the keyboard to make a program start. Theres no mouse, little 
		help and no lovely buttons to show you what you're doing. So beware this is not 
		for the PC illiterate.
		<p class="normal">
		There are two versions of the command line MESS, one for Windows and one for 
		DOS. The windows version is by far the easiest of the command line versions as 
		most of the configuration is done by Windows itself. The DOS version requires 
		you to set sound details, screen resolutions and have various drivers set up 
		for mice etc...

		Heres an example of how to run a command line MESS...

		<hr><h2>MESS GUI</h2>
		
		<p class="normal">
		The easiest version of MESS is MESS GUI (Graphical User Interface) which has a 
		user friendly point and click interface . This version is more suited for the 
		beginner as you can see everything that you are doing.

		<p class="normal">
		It has all of the features of MESS and runs just as fast. The best part is that 
		you have a nice list of all the systems and games you have, you can have 
		preview pictures of your games and to run then you simply need to double click 
		them.
