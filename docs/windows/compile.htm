		<h1>Compiling MESS</h1>
		<p>
			(This document is based on <a href="http://www.mame.net/compilewin.html">"How to 
				compile MAME (Win32)"</a>. Since the procedure for compiling <a href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</a> and <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> are virtually 
			identical, these two documents are virtually identical)
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Compiling means</b> rebuilding the actual executable program from its source 
			code. <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> is almost fully written in C, 
			with some assembler hacks in speed-critical places. The Win32 version of <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a> is compiled with <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>, which 
			is the minimalist Win32 port of a C compiler called <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>
			and its libraries.
		</p>
		<p>
			This particular how-to is written for <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> 0.80, 
			but with a bit of luck you can compile other versions with the help of this 
			page. This how-to tells how to compile the Win32 version of <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a>, which includes both the command line and GUI versions.
		</p>
		<p>
			The MinGW development environment will be installed to
			<span class="filename">C:\MINGW</span>
			and <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> sources will be placed into
			<span class="filename">C:\MINGW\MESS</span>. Before beginning, you should make 
			sure that you do not have the directories
			<span class="filename">c:\mingw\</span>
			and
			<span class="filename">c:\download\</span>
			yet. If you do have them, rename them to another name or simply delete them (if 
			you are sure that there aren't any important files in there).
		</p>
		<p>
			Remember, when you type commands into the command prompt, you should avoid 
			making typos
			<span class="fixedsize">;-)</span>
			In this how-to, filenames and other static text are marked with the color
			<span class="filename">
					brown</span>
			and command lines or other information that you need to type in are marked with 
			the color
			<span class="command">green</span>
			.
			<hr>
			<h2>1. Get Unzip</h2>
		<p>
			First of all, most files that are transferred over the Internet are compressed, 
			to minimize download times and bandwidth costs. You might already have a 
			Windows-based uncompressing utility, but since compiling <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a> is done in a command prompt, a different kind of utility is 
			necessary. Download the following file into the directory
			<span class="filename">
					c:\windows\command\</span>
		so that the utility is accessible from any directory.
		<p>
			<table width="100%" border="2" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5">
				<TR>
					<td><span><b>File&nbsp;name</b></span></td>
					<td><span><b>File&nbsp;size</b></span></td>
					<td><span><b>Description</b></span></td>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<td><span><b><A href="http://www.mame.net/downmain.html">unzip.exe</A></b></span></td>
					<td><span>140kB</span></td>
					<td><span>This is the <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/">Info-ZIP</a> uncompressing 
								utility called UnZip/NT v5.41.</span></td>
				</TR>
			</table>
			<hr>
			<h2>2. Get Win32 ports GNU Tar and GNU Unzip</h2>
		<p>
		These utilities are needed by step 4 to properly patch the MinGW 
		toolchain.&nbsp; Again, you may already have&nbsp;an archiver capable 
		of&nbsp;extracting .tar.gz files.&nbsp;
		<p>
			<table width="100%" border="2" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5" ID="Table1">
				<TR>
					<td><span><b>File&nbsp;name</b></span></td>
					<td><span><b>File&nbsp;size</b></span></td>
					<td><span><b>Description</b></span></td>

				</TR>
			</table>
			<hr>
			<h2>3. Get MinGW</h2>
		<p>
			Then you need the MinGW files. Make a new directory, for example
			<span class="filename">
					c:\download\</span>
			and download the following files into that directory. Note that there may be 
			newer versions of these files, but <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>
		is not verified to compile with any other versions of the following files.
		<p>
			<Table width="100%" border="2" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5">

				</TR>
			</Table>
			<hr>
			<h2>4. Uncompress MinGW</h2>
		<p>
			Next we will uncompress the MinGW files and set up some environment variables 
			so that MinGW is functional. First run the MinGW installer, which will install 
			a fresh MinGW installation.&nbsp; Now you need to add a few associated files to 
			the MiNGW installation.&nbsp; Open up a command prompt. You can find it either 
			from under Start Menu&nbsp;--&gt; Programs, or you can simply select Run and 
			type command.com into the dialog box. When you have it open, type
			<span class="command">cd \Program Files\MinGW</span>
		&nbsp;and hit enter to change to the correct directory. After that, type
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span class="command">gunzip 
  c:\download\gcc-3.2.2-20030208-1.tar.gz</span>
				<li>
					<span class="command">tar -xvf gcc-3.2.2-20030208-1.tar</span>
				<LI>
					<SPAN class="command">
						<SPAN class="command">unzip c:\download\dx70_mgw.zip -d 
  c:\</SPAN>
					</SPAN></LI>
			</ul>
		<p>
			If you do not see the message "1 archive was successfully processed.", 
			re-download the archives. If you get a "Bad commmand or file name", verify once 
			again that you have
			<span class="filename">unzip.exe</span>
			in
			<span class="filename">c:\windows\command\</span>
			<hr>
			<h2>5. Set up MinGW</h2>
		<p>
			Next we will have to set up the environment variables. To make the changes 
			permanent, we will have to edit
			<span class="filename">AUTOEXEC.BAT</span>, which is a file that always gets 
			run before Windows starts up. Type
			<span class="command">
					edit \autoexec.bat</span>
		and hit enter. There might be a lot of things in there, so do not touch 
		anything else than what you are told to.
		<p>
			Find the line which says something like
			<span class="filename">
					PATH C:\WIN98;C:\WIN98\COMMAND</span>
			(there might be some other directories defined after these two). Add
			<span class="command">
					;C:\MINGW\BIN</span>
			to the end of that line, so that it will look like
			<span class="filename">
					PATH C:\WIN98;C:\WIN98\COMMAND</span><span class="command">;C:\MINGW\BIN</span>
			(again, there might be something extra in there, leave them as they are). Take 
			note that if you have added
			<span class="filename">C:\DJGPP\BIN</span>
			into that line, you should remove it. Now you can save the file (<span>ALT-F</span>
			then
			<span>S</span>) and quit (<span>ALT-F</span>
			then
			<span>X</span>
		) (These might differ depending on your language version of Windows). Then you 
		will need to reboot your computer, to make the changes effective.
		<p>
			With systems that don't use startup files (such as Windows NT, 2000 or XP), you 
			can instead type
			<span class="command">edit 
					c:\mingw\mingw.bat</span>
			and write
			<span class="command">
					SET PATH=%PATH%;c:\mingw\bin</span>
			into it. You'll have to run this file (simply type
			<span class="command">c:\mingw\mingw</span>
			to run it) before being able to use MinGW.
			<hr>
			<h2>6. Compile MESS</h2>
		<p>
			Now you can compile <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>. The <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a> source is distributed as a source override on the <a href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</a> source.&nbsp; Therefore you will need to download both the <a href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</a> and <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> source ZIPs into&nbsp;
			<span class="filename">
					c:\download\</span>
		<p>
			<Table width="100%" border="2" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5">
				<TR>
					<td><span><b>File&nbsp;name</b></span></td>
					<td><span><b>File&nbsp;size</b></span></td>
					<td><span><b>Description</b></span></td>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<td><a href="http://mirrors.xmission.com/mame/main/mame080s.zip"><b>mame080s.zip</b></a>
					</td>
					<td>9208 kB</td>
					<td>This is the source archive of <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a> 0.80.</td>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<td><a href="http://www.retrogames.com/mess/mess080s.zip"><b>mess080s.zip</b></a>
					</td>
					<td>2717 kB</td>
					<td>This is the source archive of <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> 0.80.</td>
				</TR>
			</Table>
		<p>
			Go to the download directory by typing
			<span class="command">
					cd \download</span>
			and uncompress the <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a> and <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a> sources by typing the following commands
			<UL>
				<LI>
					<span class="command"> unzip mame080s.zip</span></LI>
				<LI>
					<SPAN class="command">unzip mame.zip -d c:\mingw\mess\</SPAN></LI>
				<LI>
					<SPAN class="command"></SPAN><SPAN class="command">unzip </SPAN></SPAN>
					<span class="command"> mess080s.zip -d c:\mingw\mess\</span>
					.</LI></UL>
		<p>
			Then you can compile <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>. Type
			<span class="command">make -f makefile.mes</span>
			and hit enter. This will finally compile <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>
			itself. If you want to compile the CPU optimized versions, type
			<span class="command">make -f makefile.mes 
					I686=1</span>
			or
			<span class="command">make -f makefile.mes K6=1</span>
			instead of just
			<span class="command">make -f makefile.mes</span>
		. It will take a lot of time, ranging from 15 minutes to an hour depending on 
		your CPU speed, so go get yourself something to drink.
		<p>
			When the compilation is done, you can type
			<span class="command">
					dir</span>. You should see a brand new
			<span class="filename">
					MESS.EXE</span>
		in there.
		<p>
			You also need to make the INI file, by typing
			<span class="command">
	mess -cc</span>
		(an abbreviation of -createconfig).
		<p>
			Congratulations, you did it!
			<hr>
			<h2>7. A new MESS appeared</h2>
		<p>
			To successfully compile a new version of <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>, 
			you should NOT uncompress a new set of sources over an old version of <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a>. Instead, rename the <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> directory 
			to another name or simply delete it totally (if you are sure that nothing 
			important is there), and then uncompress the new set of sources to an empty 
			directory.
			<hr>
			<h2>8. Then what..</h2>
		<p>
			Of course, the biggest advantage of building your own binary is the possibility 
			to tinker around with the source files. For example, to try out drivers which 
			are not fully working yet, take a look at the file
			<span class="filename">
					mess/system.c</span>
			with a normal text editor (like EDIT). The disabled drivers are marked with the 
			text TESTDRIVER. Simply remove the TEST part from a driver you want to test, 
			save the file and type
			<span class="command">
					make -f makefile.mes</span>
		again. Remember, the license forbids you from redistributing binaries that 
		contain systems which are disabled in the official versions. Naturally, there 
		should not be any reasons to redistribute such binaries since this page makes 
		it easy for everybody to build their own binaries.
		<p>
			You might notice that the executables created by the build are much larger than 
			the ones released by the <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> team.&nbsp; 
			This is because the <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> releases are 
			archived with <a href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/">UPX</a> to make them 
			smaller.
			<hr>
			<h2>9. Debug modes</h2>
		<p>
			To include the debugger functionality in your <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>
			executable, edit
			<span class="filename">
					makefile.mes</span>. Near the top you will see a text like "uncomment 
			next line to include the debugger". Remove the
			<span class="command">
					#</span>
			character from the next line, so that it only has
			<span class="filename">
					DEBUG = 1</span>
			in that particular line. Save the file, type
			<span class="command">
					make -f makefile.mes clean</span>
			and then
			<span class="command">make -f makefile.mes</span>. To actually use the 
			debugger, edit
			<span class="filename">
					MESS.INI</span>
			and find the line that says
			<span class="filename">
					debug = no</span>. Change it to
			<span class="filename">
					debug 
					= yes </span>
			and save the file. In <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>, hit tilde 
			(&nbsp;<span>~</span>&nbsp;) or key to the left of the key &nbsp;<span>1</span>
			&nbsp; to enter the debugger.</p>
