		<h1>Installing BIOS Files and Software Images</h1>
		<p>First, it is important to make a distinction between the two types of files 
			needed to run MESS systems.&nbsp; BIOSes are files that contain code that exist 
			in ROM on the system board, and the term "software" encompasses files 
			representing cartridges and disk images not on the system themselves.&nbsp; We 
			avoid usage of the term ROM because other emulators use that term for images 
			that would fall in either of the above category.</p>
		<hr align="center" width="98%">
		<h2>Where to find?</h2>
		<p class="normal">It is important to remember that both BIOSes and Software Images 
			are subject to copyright law.&nbsp; Hence, it is illegal to have BIOSes for 
			systems that you do not have; you need to obtain these by dumping the ROMs from 
			the system boards of the systems you wish to emulate.&nbsp; On some systems, it 
			isn't that hard to write the relevant ROM to a medium like a cassette and 
			transfer it to a PC.</p>
		<P class="normal">It is also worth noting that MESS expects BIOSes to be "pure"; in 
			other words a straight dump from the&nbsp;system.&nbsp; Other emulators may use 
			a slightly different format of may have their BIOSes prefixed&nbsp;with 
			bytes.&nbsp; Needless to say, such BIOSes would not work in MESS.</P>
		<P class="normal">Software Images are a different story, while many software images 
			are copyrighted, many are not and you can obtain them&nbsp;</P>
		<hr align="center" width="98%">
		<h2>Where to put 'em
			<P></P>
		</h2>
		<p class="normal">BIOSes are placed in subdirectories off of the MESS BIOS 
			directory with names matching that of the system.&nbsp; For example, the CoCo 3 
			has the following BIOS files:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p class="filename">bios\coco3\coco3.rom</p>
			<li>
				<p class="filename">bios\coco3\disk11.rom</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="normal">Alternatively, these BIOS files can be placed in a ZIP file. In 
			the above case, there would be a
			<span class="filename">coco3.zip</span>
			file in the
			<span class="filename">bios</span>
			directory.&nbsp; This ZIP file would have
			<span class="filename">coco3.rom</span>
			and
			<span class="filename">disk11.rom</span>
			in its root.</p>
		<p class="normal">Software Images are typically placed in similar subdirectories 
			(e.g.
			<span class="filename">software/coco3/MyCoolCocoGame.dsk</span>).&nbsp; This is 
			the default place to put software images; the GUI will first look for software 
			images in this directory, and command line relative paths will be based off of 
			this directory (e.g.
			<span class="command">mess coco3 -flop MyCoolCocoGame.dsk</span>).&nbsp; 
			However, placing software images here is not mandatory and one can tell the GUI 
			to look for Software Images elsewhere or can specify an absolute path at the 
			command line.
		</p>
		<p class="normal">On a last note, one can run command line MESS with the option
			<span class="command">-createdir</span>
			to create all requisite software directories.</p>
