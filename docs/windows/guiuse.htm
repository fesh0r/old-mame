		<h2>Usage</h2>
		<p class="normal">Here's the MESS GUI screen...</p>
		<p align="center" class="Tutorial"><img src="images/gui.gif" width="550" height="481"></p>
		<p class="normal">As you can see it's very straightforward. At the top you have 
			the menus that are described on the <a href="messguiconfig.htm" target="_blank">MESS 
				GUI Config</a> page. Under that there are a few buttons which are used to 
			control how the system and software lists are shown. the first two will decide 
			whether the folder list and screenshot page are shown. The rest will change the 
			icons size and description in the lists.</p>
		<p class="normal">The first thing to do is select the system you want to use in 
			the first list. If you have any software installed it will automatically show 
			up in the second list.</p>
		<p class="normal">To run a system you need to double click it and MESS will load 
			it for you. There are some systems that will only run if software is present. 
			This applies especially to console based systems. To load these systems you 
			need to click the piece of software you want to run from the software list. 
			MESS will then load it for you.</p>
		<p class="normal">MESS like Mame allows you to add screenshots and system picture 
			to the GUI. These are normally kept in large Zip files in the C:\MESS\snap 
			folder. You can get snapshots from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/messroms/" target="_blank">
				here</a>.</p>
