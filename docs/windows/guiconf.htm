			<h1>GUI Configuration</h1>
			<p class="normal">
			This section deals with configuring and running the MESS GUI. It includes a 
			quickstart guide, the menu options and an in depth look at the configuration 
			window.
			<p>&nbsp;
				<hr>
			<h2>
			Quick Start
            </h2>
			<p>
			Open MESS GUI by pressing its icon, you will see a screen like this:
			<p align="center"><img alt="easyEmu!" src="images/gui.gif" width="550" height="481" border="1">
			<p>
			When you run MESS GUI for the first time it will automatically hunt for 
			available BIOS files. If it doesn't find any or you add more press "F5" to 
			update the system list.
			<h2>
			Menu Options
            </h2>
			<p>
			MESS GUI is far easier to use than the command line versions of MESS. Most of 
			the functions can be accessed from its menus. Here is the complete description 
			of all of MESS GUI's menus...

			<p>You must remember that changing these settings affects all systems. Sometimes

				The obvious answer is if the system you are using performs badly and other 
				systems don't, change it's settings individually using the file menu -&gt;
