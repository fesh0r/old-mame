			Updating MESS to a newer version
            </h2>
			<p class="normal">
			MESS is in constant development so if you have MESS already and a new version 
			appears then it isn't very clear how to install the newer version and the 
			problems that could arise.
			<p class="normal">
			To update from one version of MESS to a newer version all you need to do is to 
			extract the new zip file into your existing C:\MESS directory overwriting all 
			the old files.
			<p class="normal">
			There is a problem attached to this in the fact that as MESS is developed the 
			BIOS files can change. This is normally due to the MESS developers replacing 
			old, incorrect or missing BIOSes to make the different systems work properly.
			<p class="normal">
			A good way to check any changes is to read the <span class="filename">messnew.txt</span> as it will tell you 
			what new games have been added and any changes that have happened to older 
			games.
			<p class="normal">For more information on BIOS files and updating them check out 
				the <a href="mgebios.htm">Managing BIOS Files</a>
			section.
