		<h1>MESS Configuration Files</h1>
		<p class="normal">This section deals with configuration files used by MESS. You 
			will find an explanation on how to find create configuration files for your 
			games and where to put them.
		</p>
			<hr>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p class="normal">
		In MESS you have always been able to configure each game individually MESS 
		GUI is the same. This is of great use if for instance you are having 
		performance issues with systems or say want to run certain systems in windows 
		and others in full screen. The command line version of MESS or Mame never had 
		this option so you had to change the command line for each game you wanted 
		different settings on.
		<p class="normal">
		Now with the latest versions of MESS and Mame you can have configuration files 
		for any system or clone system you want and when MESS starts it will 
		automatically load the settings for you.
		<p class="normal">&nbsp;

		<h2>
		Creating The Files
        </h2>
		<p class="normal">
		The settings files are based on the <span class="filename">MESS.ini</span> file that is created when MESS 
		starts. The easiest way to create a new config file is to simply duplicate the 
		original file and remove/change the stuff you don't want.
		<p class="normal">
		Open you MESS folder and find the <span class="filename">MESS.ini</span> file. It'll look someting like 
		this...
		<p align="center"><img src="images/iniicon.gif" width="166" height="61" border="1">
		<p class="normal">
		Right click on the file and select copy. Now right click on a blank area and 
		select paste and you will see a file &quot;copy of MESS&quot; appear. Right 
		click over this file and select rename. In the box type the name of the sysem 
		as it appears on the original BIOS zip file e.g. Atari 2600 = a2600.
		<p class="normal">
		It will keep things a lot tidier if you move your new config file to the ini 
		folder. MESS will by default look there anyway.
		<p class="normal">Double click your config file and it should open up in notepad. 
			Below you can see the default <span class="filename">MESS.ini</span> file.

		<p class="normal">As you can see most of the lines mimic the command line options 
			use by MESS and you can find detailed explanantions of these commands on the <a href="win32cmd.htm" target="_blank">
				MESS W32 Commands</a>
		page. The only difference is the 1 or 0 that follows the command. These mean 
		yes (1) or no (0) on most commands but check on the setup page as they may 
		refer to a value. The lines starting with # are comments and are ignored by 
		MESS.
		<p class="normal">
		Remember no matter what changes you make you cant mess up MESS, just change the 
		setting back or delete the config file and start again.

		<h2>
		Types Of Config Files</h2>
		<p class="normal">
		There are four types of config types. You have one for vector games called 
		<span class="filename">vector.ini</span> and one for specific drivers for games e.g. <span class="filename">cps2.ini</span> or <span class="filename">neogeo.ini</span> 
		You can also create files for specific parent rom sets that will be used by all 
		of the clones or you can make config file for specific clones.
		<p class="normal">To find out what drivers a game uses you can add the -verbose 
			option to your command line. e.g. <span class="command">MESS a2600 -verbose</span> and will give you 
			something like the following...
			<table width="52%" border="1" align="center">

					<td class="consoletext">

		If you look at the first couple of lines you can see the ini files that MESS is 
		looking for. MESS always loads the MESS.ini file first but in this instance it 
		looks for the <span class="filename">a2600.ini</span> file (system file). If I had used a clone system MESS 
		would also look for the .ini file for that as well. Each of these files would 
		override the previous one and MESS would only use the commands in the final 
		config file.
		<p class="normal">As an example of a config file, here is one that I have made up 
			for the Atari 2600 system. The reason behind it was that I wanted it to run 
			fullscreen as it was easier to see. The d3d option made MESS use my 3D card to 
			draw the graphics as it's faster on my system.

				</tr>
			</table>

		<p class="normal">
		Once you are happy with your file save it and run MESS and it will use your new 
		settings.
