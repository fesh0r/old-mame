<h1>MESS Configuration Files</h1>
<p class="normal">This section deals with configuration files used by MESS. You will find an explanation on how to find create configuration files
for your games and where to put them.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="normal">In MESS you have always been able to configure each game individually MESS GUI is the same. This is of great use if for instance
you are having performance issues with systems or say want to run certain systems in windows and others in full screen. The command line version of
MESS or Mame never had this option so you had to change the command line for each game you wanted different settings on.</p>
<p class="normal">Now with the latest versions of MESS and Mame you can have configuration files for any system or clone system you want and when
MESS starts it will automatically load the settings for you.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h2>Creating The Files</h2>
<p class="normal">The settings files are based on the <span class="filename">MESS.ini</span> file that is created when MESS starts. The easiest way
to create a new config file is to simply duplicate the original file and remove/change the stuff you don't want.</p>
<p class="normal">Open you MESS folder and find the <span class="filename">MESS.ini</span> file. It'll look someting like this...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/iniicon.gif" width="166" height="61" border="1" /></p>
<p class="normal">Right click on the file and select copy. Now right click on a blank area and select paste and you will see a file "copy of MESS"
appear. Right click over this file and select rename. In the box type the name of the sysem as it appears on the original BIOS zip file e.g. Atari
2600 = a2600.</p>
<p class="normal">It will keep things a lot tidier if you move your new config file to the ini folder. MESS will by default look there anyway.</p>
<p class="normal">Double click your config file and it should open up in notepad. Below you can see the default <span class="filename">MESS.ini</span> file.</p>

<p class="normal">As you can see most of the lines mimic the command line options use by MESS and you can find detailed explanantions of these
commands on the <a href="win32cmd.htm" target="_blank">MESS W32 Commands</a> page. The only difference is the 1 or 0 that follows the command. These
mean yes (1) or no (0) on most commands but check on the setup page as they may refer to a value. The lines starting with # are comments and are
ignored by MESS.</p>
<p class="normal">Remember no matter what changes you make you cant mess up MESS, just change the setting back or delete the config file and start
again.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h2>Types Of Config Files</h2>
<p class="normal">There are four types of config types. You have one for vector games called <span class="filename">vector.ini</span> and one for
specific drivers for games e.g. <span class="filename">cps2.ini</span> or <span class="filename">neogeo.ini</span> You can also create files for
specific parent rom sets that will be used by all of the clones or you can make config file for specific clones.</p>
<p class="normal">To find out what drivers a game uses you can add the -verbose option to your command line. e.g. <span class="command">MESS a2600
-verbose</span> and will give you something like the following...</p>

<p class="normal">If you look at the first couple of lines you can see the ini files that MESS is looking for. MESS always loads the MESS.ini file
first but in this instance it looks for the <span class="filename">a2600.ini</span> file (system file). If I had used a clone system MESS would also
look for the .ini file for that as well. Each of these files would override the previous one and MESS would only use the commands in the final config
file.</p>
<p class="normal">As an example of a config file, here is one that I have made up for the Atari 2600 system. The reason behind it was that I wanted
it to run fullscreen as it was easier to see. The d3d option made MESS use my 3D card to draw the graphics as it's faster on my system.</p>
