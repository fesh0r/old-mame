----------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.142.  This incorporates all features of the
  update to this core.  [MAME team]

- Added support for a new template to -snapname to use software names for 
  snapshots. It is now possible to use %d_XXXX to name snaps after the name
  of the file mounted in the device XXXX, being XXXX the brief name of any
  device. E.g. you can use "-snapname %d_cart" to use the name of the game 
  mounted in the cartslot, or "-snapname %d_flop2" to use the name of the game 
  mounted in the second floppy drive, etc. If you are loading software through 
  software lists, its shortname will be used; if you are using the fullpath of 
  the software, its filename is used. Any combination of the new template with 
  the old "/", "%g" and "%i" templates is supported as well. Notice that if you 
  specify an invalid device, or if you have no software mounted in the chosen 
  device, MESS will revert to the default template "%g/%i". [Fabio Priuli]

  a result carts are now working. Also removed -cart2 device, since
  C16 / C116 / Plus4 had only a single cartridge port. [Fabio Priuli]

- [C16] Fixed behavior of Joystick Ports Swapping: if you press F1 in
  partial keyboard emulation, Joy1 keys will go to Joy2 port (as if you
  had plugged your joystick in port 2). This helps with games which expect
  joystick inputs from port 2 of the C16 [Fabio Priuli]

- [C128] Added support for tape emulation using MESS core functions
  (loading and saving, both .wav and .tap formats) [Fabio Priuli]

- [C128] Refactored cartridge code to rely on MESS core functions.

  (loading and saving, both .wav and .tap formats) [Fabio Priuli, Roberto
  Zandona']

- [C64] Fixed border color during tape loading [Roberto Zandona']

  (8k and 16k images) [Fabio Priuli]

- [C64] Fixed behavior of Joystick Ports Swapping: if you press F1 in
  partial keyboard emulation, Joy1 keys will go to Joy2 port (as if you
  had plugged your joystick in port 2). This helps with games which expect
  joystick inputs from port 2 of the C64 [Fabio Priuli]

- [C64] Fixed memory leaks with floppies [Oliver Stöneberg]

- [C64] Fixed floppy unmounting [Oliver Stöneberg]

  .crt support (.10, .20, .40 and .60 files working as before) since I
  doubt these CBM-II computers used the same format as C64. More work
  when/if more documents will be available [Fabio Priuli]

- [CGENIE] Properly implemented the cassette loading.  [Wilbert Pol]

- [COMMODORE] Properly fixed asserts / freezes / crashes in systems with
  VC1540 / VC1541 floppy support which had been promoted from TESTDRIVER
  status. However, they are flagged as NOT_WORKING because the floppy
  emulation is not implemented yet. [Fabio Priuli]

- [COMMODORE] Cleaned up documentation and comments in c16.c, c64.c, c65.c,
  c128.c, cbmb.c, pet.c and vc20.c. Added missing BASIC revisions, new
  sets and new clones. Removed models and configurations which were never
  sold. In particular, I've tagged as BAD_DUMPS most of the C128/C128D PAL
  BIOSes and started to use split kernal & character ROMs to make clear
  their origin and possible incompleteness. When dumps will be confirmed,
  we will start to use the correct ones. If you own a C128 PAL, please
  dump its BIOS to verify its content. [Fabio Priuli]

- [EXIDY] Added support for cassette images. [Robbbert, Wilbert Pol]

- [EXIDY] Fixed Centronics printing. [Robbbert]

  will be available [Fabio Priuli]

- [SG1000] Lightgun crosshair is now shown only if TV Draw cartridge is
  loaded. [Curt Coder]

0.61.1

New System Drivers Supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------------
- Amstrad family (fixed and reenabled) [Raphael Nabet]

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- [COCO1] Update CRC for bas10.rom. Previous dump was bad. I would like to send
  a pecial "Thank you" to Sellam Ismail (http://www.vintage.org) for finding a
  Color Computer that contained Color BASIC 1.0. [tim lindner]

- [COCO1/2/3] Moved disk handling code over to new FormatDriver system;
  allowing transparent disk image handling for JVC, VDK, and DMK file formats.
  [Nate Woods]

- [COCO] Fixed a recent stupid bug in m6847 timing that had an effect on
  certain timing situations (bug #249) [Nate Woods]

- [COCO3] Fixed a palette timing bug that affected mid-frame video rendering.
  (bug #253) [Nate Woods]

- [COCO3] Fixed a bug where hi-res text characters with the high bit set were

- [COCO3] Fixed a bug where $FF9D and associated registers were being updated
  before vblank, when they should have been updated after. (bug #252) [Nate
  Woods]

- [COCO1/2/3] Made sure that SAM (and GIME on the CoCo 3) registers are
  properly reset after a crash. [Nate Woods]

- [DRAGON32/64] Made artifacting disabled by default, as this is how PAL systems
  would normally be.  [Nate Woods]

- [DRAGON64] Fixed a bug that prevented the system to run (the dragon64 driver
  was using the coco memory map) [Nate Woods]

- [DRAGON64] Adjusted the memory mapping scheme, enabling the DragonDOS
  cartridge and 64k mode to coexist.  Thanks to Simon Hardy for tracking down a
  better algorithm. [Nate Woods]

- [A5200] Fixed a regression in 0.61 that prevented the keypad from working.
  (bug #246) [Nate Woods]

- [A7800] Suffixed the name of the a7800 driver with NTSC and marked the PAL
  version as a clone of the NTSC version. [Nate Woods]

- [GBCOLOR] Implemented background priority. This fixes objects appearing over
  the background when they shouldn't be. [Anthony Kruize]

- [TI99/4A] Added support for BwG clock and floppy controller [Raphael Nabet]

- [SNES] Memory map is more accurate, adding support for HiRom carts. Fixed
  DMA transfers. Fixed missing tiles. Added preliminary mode 7 support. Added
  subscreens, including colour addition/subtraction. Fixed vertical flip for
  large objects. Improved vertical/horizontal latches. Improved ROM loading
  with better header and ROM type detection. Improved the SPCSkipper so a lot
  more games actually run now. [Anthony Kruize]

Source Changes:
---------------
- The MESS core will not automatically open software images in a clone system
  drivers directory anymore, under the belief that this functionality belongs
  in the OSD code. [Nate Woods]

- All MESS drivers need a SYSTEM_CONFIG (formerly COMPUTER_CONFIG) parameter
  specified.  Also changed the implementation of the SYSTEM_CONFIG_* macros to
  provide a more flexible system for representing the data.

  Added the ability for devices to be declared within the SYSTEM_CONFIG block.
  Consider the older way of declaring devices deprecated.

  Added new functions for iterating through devices, in order to better
  abstract the internal representation of devices:

	device_first()
	device_next()
	device_find()

  Also renamed GameDriver dev field to dev_ in order to break any source
  dependencies on the dev field. [Nate Woods]

- Added new memory pool code that implements memory pools that can be freed in
  one step. [Nate Woods]

- Overhaul of code that maintained the list of loaded images; moved to
  mess/image.[c|h], and changed the prefix of them from device_ to image_ (as
  opposed to the device_* calls that are used to access the IODevice
  structure).  Also, implemented these new calls for drivers to use:

	image_malloc()    (similar to auto_malloc(), but for the lifetime of devices)
	image_strdup()    (uses image_malloc() to allocate strings)
	image_exists()    (tests for the existance of a loaded image)
	image_filetype()  (accessor for file extension)

  For the most part, there is no longer any reason for MESS drivers to use
  malloc() and free(), so calls to these should be eliminated over time. [Nate
  Woods]

- Removed IO_RESET_ALL, as it was broken and an ugly hack to begin with (bug
  #239) [Nate Woods]

- In the opening display software info box, if the filename and the goodname
  (as determined by CRC) match up, the goodname will not be displayed in
  order to reduce screen clutter. [Nate Woods]

- Removed all calls to device_close(IO_CASSETTE) in system drivers, instead
  provided a cassette_exit() function that drivers can specify, removing this
  responsibility from system drivers. [Nate Woods]

- Implemented preliminary paste functionality; it attempts to decode the
  driver's input tables and attempts to create a mapping between ASCII and
  input signals.  This process is far from perfect at this time.  In the
  future, it will be possible for drivers to customize the way that paste works
  for a more perfect translation.  [Nate Woods]

- Added new PORT_KEYx macros that should be used in place of PORT_BITX when
  mapping keyboards.  These macros also specify unicode values for the input
  codes for natural keyboard support.  [Nate Woods]

- Added a new osd_keyboard_disabled() call.  If this returns non-zero, then
  the core will supress input of type IPT_KEYBOARD.  This is useful if a front
  end wants to implement a natural keyboard.  [Nate Woods]

- Added a new osd_parallelize() call, for basic SMP acceleration.  [Nate Woods]

- Renamed osd_dir.h to osd_mess.h, to further reflect that it is more than just
  directory calls.  [Nate Woods]

- [Win32] New -threads parameter, to specify the maximum amount of threads used
  for osd_parallelize(); defaults to the number of processors in the system.
  [Nate Woods]

- [Win32 GUI] Printers are now treated separately from the other devices; you
  do not specify printer ouput like you do disk images.  Printer output now
  gets specified in the configuration tab of the system properties.  The added
  benefit is that the same output file can be used repeatedly. [Nate Woods]

- [Imgtool] Imgtool floppy drivers can now be "templated"; a driver for a
  particular file system format can point at a structure that lists allowable
  disk image formats.  This allows for the addition of new disk image format
  drivers without touching the imgtool drivers. [Nate Woods]

- [Imgtool] Fixed a bug in the FormatDriver handling that caused some file puts
  to not be properly written.  [Nate Woods]

- [Imgtool] Added Color Computer DMK disk image support. [tim lindner]

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- [COCO] The virtual printer should now be responsive to bitbanger output of
  any arbitrary baud. [Nate Woods]

- [COCO] Fixed a OKI M6242B clock emulation problem and a problem with Disto
  Real Time Clock emulation. [tim lindner]

- [COCO] Fixed a very ugly bug that could cause freezups under OS-9 and other
  forms of disk accesses.  This was because interrupts were dropped when the
  CPU is halted. (Bugs #197, #229) [Nate Woods]

- [COCO3] Fixed a bug in the GIME video emulation that caused all parts of
  the $FF9B/D/E video registers to be used in lo-res mode; where in reality
  the low 16 bits are dropped.  This caused a bug in CoCoTracker that caused
  the screen to be garbled after the MOD files are played. [Nate Woods]

- [COCO3] Adjusted composite colors slightly with help from SockMaster (Bug
  #227) [John Kowalski, Nate Woods]

- [COCO3] Exposed the two high bits on MMU registers (even though their value
  is undefined) to fix a problem with SockMaster's LSAVEM utility. [Nate Woods]

- [COLECO] The Coleco driver now recognizes the *.col extension for Coleco
  cartridges. [Nate Woods]

- [SPECPL3E] Updated BIOS to the 1.11 version romset
  (http://www.z88forever.org.uk/zxplus3e/) [Stefano Priore]

- [GAMEBOY] Can now load ROMs that are larger than 2MB. Fixed RAM bank
  switching in MBC3 ROMs. [Anthony Kruize]

- [COUPE] Combined coupe and coupe512 drivers into one driver that uses
  configurable RAM sizes. [Nate Woods]

- [A2600] Converted video code from using plot_pixel() to draw_scanline() [Nate
  Woods]

- [VTECH1] Converted back to using generic M6847 video hardware module (Bug #36)
  [Nate Woods]

- [SNES] Rewrite of the driver.  Still at a preliminary stage though. Some
  games are playable, others run but aren't playable, however most don't work.
  [Anthony Kruize]

- [VECTREX] Because of the MAME core's new artwork system, new .art files are
  now needed in conjunction with the normal Vectrex .png files to specify the
  artwork layout. [Nate Woods]

- [GENESIS] Changed input ports to be consistent with other drivers.
  [Anthony Kruize]

Source Changes:
---------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.61.  This incorporates all features of the
  update to this core.  [MAME team]

- Converted numerous drivers to use the auto_malloc() and auto_bitmap_alloc()
  calls, and also to use generic_bitmapped video calls. [Nate Woods]

- Added new videomap code that makes it easy to support arbitrary video modes
  in a fast, efficient manner.  This takes the place of the old
  rasterbits/rastertrack code; converted m6847, CoCo 3, and Mac video hardware
  to use videomap. [Nate Woods]

- Added a new disk format handling system that allows disk formats to be
  generically specified in such a way usable by both MESS itself, and imgtool
  [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug in the wave code that could cause a crash if a cassette image is
  unloaded. [Nate Woods]

- Added a [none] entry in the File Manager, that allows the user to unload an
  image. [Nate Woods]

- The file manager will now default to the directory that a preexisting image
  resides in. [Nate Woods]

- Fixed some bugs that caused the battery backups in the NES and GB systems to
  be placed in odd directories. [Nate Woods]

- Added palette_set_colors() function to make it easy to initialize a palette
  with a predefined list of colors. [Nate Woods]

- Readded record/playback support. [Nate Woods]

- Added artwork_use_device_art() to the MAME core to support Vectrex style
  artwork. [Nate Woods]

- Fixed bugs #192 and #200 - remember that:

  1) In File Manager you can press SHIFT+ENTER to manually edit a filename
     and CTRL-Y to delete the field.

  2) In the file selector you can edit the file specification and you can use
     SHIFT+UP/DOWN as PgUp/PgDown and
     CTRL+UP/DOWN as Home/End. [Stefano Priore]

- With help from SockMaster, fixed some very subtle timer bugs in the m6809
  and hd6309 CPU cores [Nate Woods, tim lindner, John Kowalski]

- New OSD function:

		void osd_device_eject(int type, int id);

  It sets a device image to NULL, as would a device_filename_change(type, id,
  NULL), but enables osd code to update its osd structures.  The mac and lisa
  drivers will use this function instead of device_filename_change to eject
  floppy disks.

  This function is needed because the mac osd code keeps track of each
  selected file, and the data went out of sync when device_filename_change
  was called. [Raphael Nabet]

- [GUI] Fixed a very minor bug that caused the software list view background
  to not be updated at the same time as the system list if the snap directory
  was changed. [Nate Woods]

0.56.1

New System Drivers Supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------------

  battery backed ram(Bug #133). Sprites no longer have inverted colours in some
  games(Bug #26). Fixed window layer positioning(Bug #39). Changed the palette
  to closer resemble the LCD screen(Bug #87). Games which originally have no
  sound don't produce bass sound at start up(Bug #195). Improved LCD status
  timing and interrupts(Bug #117). [Anthony Kruize]

- [CGENIE] Floppy initialization fixed for when no floppy attached
  (Bug #95) [Ben Bruscella]

- [UK101/SUPERBOARD] Cassette Initialization fixed [Stefano Priore]

- [MBEE] Renamed mbeepc to mbeepc85. Now mbee emulates the IC model (editor

  displayed (see the "Input" menu) [Stefano Priore]

- [SPECTRUM] 48k machines are now able to run code in screen memory (Bug #46).
  Fixed problem with interrupt vector set to 0xffff (much more 128k games works
  now). Corrected frames per second value for 48k and 128k Sincalir machines.
  Remaped some Spectrum+ keys. Added support to load .SP snapshots. Added .BLK
  tape images support. #FF port emulation added (Arkanoid works now but is still
  not playable due to wrong timings) (Bug #47). [Krzysztof Strzecha]

- [SPECPL3E] Updated BIOS to the 1.10 version and added support for the spanish
  romset (http://www.z88forever.org.uk/zxplus3e/) [Stefano Priore]

- [TI99/4A] xtensive rewrite: The code should be more flexible and more readable.
  * Updated tms9901 code.

  * Added support for EVPC video card. [Raphael Nabet]

- [AMSTRAD CPC] Fixed RAM configuration selection, now the original Heroquest
  will run [Kev Thacker, Richard Wilson]

- [COCO] Converted CoCo drivers to use configurable RAM sizes, and the CoCo 3
  driver now supports the 2 MB upgrade (if I knew the specs, it would be very
  trivial for me to support the 8 MB upgrade). [Nate Woods]

- [COCO] Fixed a bug in DMK disk image on little endian machines. (Bug #179)
  [Nate Woods]

- [PC] Fixed a bug that caused the keyboard buffer to get flooded and the
  emulated system to get paralyzed in beeping under certain situations (bug
  #151). [Nate Woods]

- [EXIDY & KC85/3] These drivers now startup with the MAME 0.56 core. [Kev Thacker]

- [EINSTEIN] Implemented more interrupts and fixed their priorities [Kev Thacker]

- [SORD M5] Cassette writing is working, but loading is not :( [Kev Thacker]

- [TS1000] The main rom file is now called zx81a.rom, instead of zx81.rom in
  order to match the other drivers in the family. [Nate Woods]

- [COCO3] Added support for Jeff Vavassour's virtual hard disk. His Color
  Computer 3 emulator comes with an OS-9 driver. [tim lindner]

- [INTV] Added collision detection (Bug #163) [Kyle Davis]

- [PDP1] Added support for perforated tape and read-in mode.  Removed the
  current image load hack, since the use of the perforated tape reader in
  read-in mode enables the user to enter programs in an historically-correct
  way.  Various additional bug-fixes and some code clean-up.
  Added control panel, variuos memory sizes, automatic multiply/divide,
  interactive typewriter display and Spacewar! supports hyperspace controls
  now. IO code has been rewrote and timings are greatly improved.
  Teletyper output can be logged to a file (via -printer switch).
  Added support for sequence break system.
  Simulation of CRT remanence. WARNING: .rim files must be run pressing
  LCTRL+ENTER to switch into read-in mode! [Raphael Nabet]

- [APPLE1] Snapshot support added - memory dumps loaded via the image MESS
  loading interface.  The images need a header, using the following
  format - "LOAD:xxyyDATA:".  This header enables the emulation to load the
  data to the correct location.  [Ben Bruscella, Stefano Priore]

- [NES] Now uses battery_save() and battery_load() to save and load battery
  backed NVRAM. [Nate Woods]

- [GENESIS] Fixed broken input in some games(Bug #139). [Anthony Kruize]

- [VECTREX] Improved detection of 3D games. [Cowering]

- [sysinfo.dat] Updates to genesis and nes [Hobie Troxell]

Source Changes:
---------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.56.  This incorporates all features of the
  update to this core.  [MAME team]

- The core now supports configurable RAM sizes; drivers can expose RAM
  configurations (e.g. 4k, 16k, 32k etc) and on Windows, this setting is
  exposed through a command line switch -ramsize.  [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug that prevented introducing completely new software images when
  there was already one of that particular image type already loaded. [Nate
  Woods]

- Added some infrastructure for automated tests. [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug in tape handling that would cause rewind and fast forward to not
  work if the system was stopping the tape (bug #168). [Nate Woods]

- Added battery_save() and battery_load() functions to abstract handling of
  battery-backed NVRAM on cartridges. [Nate Woods]

- Modified osd_fopen() with OSD_FILETYPE_NVRAM so that the filename parameter
  can specify subdirectories (for use by battery_save() and battery_load().
  [Anthony Kruize, Nate Woods]

------------------------------------------------------
- Chess Champion MK II [PeT]

System Driver Changes:
----------------------

- [ATOM] Finished floppy disc emulation. To use it you require a rom using
  the original 8271 memory locations (0x0a00-0x0a04). Linked in 6522via,
  more programs should work with it. Added printer support.
  [Kev Thacker, Kees van Oss]

- [BBC] Added a new BBC clone (BBCB1770) to use the WD1770 disc controller.
  Much improved SAA5050 teletext support (mode 7), There is still a
  problem with the Mode 7 cursor.

  actually run now. [Lee Ward]

- [Vectrex] Loading carts should work again. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

- [ORIC] Rewrote to use 6522via code in MESS core. Previously it had it's own
  implementation which was not complete. Added floppy disc emulation (emulates a
  Microdisc interface). Added support for MFM_DISK disk image type as used by
  Euphoric. This driver uses the IO_CASSETTE device, and can be controlled with
  the "Tape Control" menu. However, this is not working yet.
  Previous method for loading tapes has been disabled. Floppy disc emulation
  does not appear to be working fully yet. [Kev Thacker]

- [COCO/DRAGON] Added support for printer.  Optimized graphics emulation. [Nate
  Woods]

- [Studio II] added cartridge support [PeT]

- Sharp Pocket Computer PC1251 [Peter Trauner]

System Driver Changes:
----------------------

- [ATOM] Added preliminary floppy disc emulation. [Kev Thacker]

- [BBC B] Updated to use updated 8271 FDC code. Disk images can be used and games
  can be loaded and played. [Kev Thacker]

- [BBC B] Cleaned up the memory accessing a little. This fixed a problem with
  the DNFS rom thinking it found an econet controller. [Gordon Jefferyes]

- [SAM COUPE] Updated Sam Coupe to use WD179x code (same as WD1772). [Kev Thacker]

- [COCO] Updated CoCo and CoCo 3 drivers with new rom sets to match the actual chips
  in the system.  coco.rom split into bas12.rom, extbas11.rom and disk11.rom, and
  coco3.rom now must be of length 32768.  This requires a dump from an EPROM reader.
  Fixed a bug in cassette writing.  Cassette tape controls and CoCo motor signal now
  operate independently.  [Nate Woods]

- [C16] added SIDCARD support at address $d400 [Peter Trauner]

- [NES] new sound core. [Matt Conte]

Other Changes:
--------------

  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team]

- Fixed write protect reporting in WD179x [Kev Thacker]

- Added "Disk Control" menu to the user interface. With this you can
  enable/disable a drive (e.g. this is comparable to connecting a disconnecting
  a drive to the real machine), set write enable/write protect of the disc,
  and selecting between disc image and real drive access. Real drive access
  is currently limited to the drivers which use the WD179x, NEC765 and Intel
  8271 floppy disc controllers. [Kev Thacker]

- Removed hard-coded disk image format in the WD179x code. This floppy
  disc controller emulation uses the same disk image access as the NEC765 and
  Intel 8271. It can now support different disk image formats, and as before
  real discs in a real drive [Kev Thacker]

- NEC765 and Intel 8271 can now use real disc access in DOS version
  of MESS. Run under pure DOS, or in a Windows 95
  DOS box mode for this to work correct. [Kev Thacker]

- Imgtool now supports CoCo cassette files (both .CAS and .WAV).  This is done
  through a framework that makes it easy to implement cassette images in
  general.  Also, the CoCo RSDOS disk handling is now a bit more tolerant
  [Nate Woods]

- Updated Intel 8271 floppy disc controller emulation. [Kev Thacker]

- CRC and sysinfo updates will now be appearing at the official MESS homepage:
  http://mess.emuverse.com

  is .;SOFTWARE
  OSD_FILETYPE_ROM uses the biospath= setting from now on (MAME rompath=) Default for
  biospath= is .;BIOS.
  OSD_FILETYPE_IMAGE_R and _RW use the softwarepath= settings from now on, so BIOS ROMs can
  be kept separate from carts, floppy, harddisk etc. images.
  The search paths/files are for a hypothetic system driver 'sys':

  extensions of carts for sys = .rom, .bin
  softwarepath = .;x:/software

  mess sys -cart cart

  ./cart
  ./sys/cart
  ./cart.zip containing cart
  ./sys/cart.zip containing cart
  x:/software/cart
  x:/software/sys/cart
  x:/software/cart.zip containing cart
  x:/software/sys/cart.zip containing cart
  ---> assume it failed, because the real extension is .bin
  ./cart.rom
  ./sys/cart.rom
  ./cart.zip containing cart.rom
  ./sys/cart.zip containing cart.rom
  x:/software/cart.rom
  x:/software/sys/cart.rom
  x:/software/cart.zip containing cart.rom
  x:/software/sys/cart.zip containing cart.rom
  ---> still not found, so image_fopen() tries .bin now
  ./cart.bin
  ./sys/cart.bin
  ./cart.zip containing cart.bin
  ./sys/cart.zip containing cart.bin
  x:/software/cart.bin
  x:/software/sys/cart.bin
  x:/software/cart.zip containing cart.bin
  x:/software/sys/cart.zip containing cart.bin

  As you can see it might take quite some time until an image is found, with two
  directories on the path already, that's why the main softwarepath= setting should be
  short. If you have many, different drives/paths where you store software, you better use
  the system specific overrides like this:

  [sys]
  biospath=x:/sys
  softwarepath=x:/sys

  [sys2]
  biospath=roms
  sofwarepath=z:/somewhere/sys2

  However, if you have a 'complete set' you would be done (mostly) if you only change the
  [directories] setting for biospath= and softwarepath= to the drive/path where your
  mirrored files are.

  One extension to the searches that might make sense would be to also look into a
  path/ext/cart.ext directory, that means you could have subirectories for eg. dsk, cas,
  vz, bin or whatever the extensions of the system are. [Juergen Buchmueller, Ben Bruscella]

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- NES: Now features battery support and vastly improved PPU emulation - compare Kirby and
  RC Pro Am.
  * Palette is no longer hardcoded - it is mathematically generated. It may need some
    formulaic tweaking, but it's pretty accurate.
  * Games like GI Joe Atlantis Factor are working again, the NES Test cartridge no longer
    fails.
  * There is a compile switch to emulate the color intensity used in Chris Covell's "Wall"
    demo.  It's off by default because it requires 16-bit mode and the sprite blitters need
    rewriting to support 16-bit. Still, you can enable it to see the demo run as it was
    intended.
  * Many mapper fixes: mapper 18 irqs should be close, mapper 19 added, the mid-20 Konami
    mappers are nearly 100%, and some of the mappers in the 60's are much more accurate.
  * Super Mario 3  _finally_ works! Excitebike also works again, and elite and PAL games,
    Elite will draw properly -- but only using the PAL NES emulation.
  * Fixed some more timing errors, Bayou Billy sine wave looks perfect now.
  * low/high sprite priorities fixed. Super Mario 3 uses low priority sprites to mask out
    pieces of high priority ones.
  * low-priority sprite/background transparency problem fixed (see Jaleco's Bases Loaded 3)
  * Mapper 5 is much better, although some interrupt problems remain.
  * Mappers 9/10 are _almost_ perfect.
  * Fixed mapper 16 - it was completely wrong.
  * Fixed rendering problems in mapper 68 (Afterburner 2).
  * Fixed mapper 69 (Batman: Return of the Joker).
  * Mapper 70 (arkanoid 2 j) works, but is it right? It starts up on round 0, which appears
    to be the last round and not the first.
  * Implemented some Taito mappers (80, 82).
  * Implemented Konami VRC7, minus OPL (mapper 85).
  * Preliminary support for the zapper via a fake dipswitch. Collision detection isn't
    working yet.
  * Modified sound core to read dpcm samples from the right place in memory. Added clock
    specifier and read/write callbacks for register $14. NES driver now hooks into this for
    sprite DMA.
  * Zapper support, configurable via the fake dipswitches. Most games look for it connected
    to the 2nd input port, not the first. Tested it with Duck Hunt and Hogan's Alley. If any
    other zapper games don't work, let me know and I'll beat them down.
  * 4-player joypad support, also configurable via the fake dipswitches. For best results,
    set both ports to the double setting. I tested it in Gauntlet 2 and RC Pro Am 2. Again,
    let me know if it's busted in any other 4p games.
  * Fixed sprite priorities for the last time. I swear it's really working now. ;-) As a
    side effect, the rendering code is a bit faster than before.
  * More mapper fixes/additions.
  * Added support for Famicom Disk System. Split up the main NES driver into NES and
    Famicom. Only the Famicom supports the disk system, because that's the way it is in
    real life. Press p1 button 3 to cycle amongst the disk sides. Once you switch a side,
    you may need to wait a second or two for the switch to be recognized. Let me know if
    any games fail to see the switch. Disk writing is not yet supported.
  * Added preliminary support for the Arkanoid paddle. It's pretty busted at the moment.
  * Fixed a small PPU bug regarding reads from the chr-gen ram portion of the ppu.
  * Correct display of left-most column when it has been programmatically disabled -
    see SMB3.
  * Added some more mappers, some of which aren't working fully.
  * Fixed mapper 40 (SMB2j pirate) - it should be close to 100%
  * Fixed some issues with the disk support. It now supports that stupid padded format with
    the useless header in addition to the other format.
  * DPCM samples fixed (now hear SMB3 in all it's steel drum glory).
    [Brad Oliver]

- COCO: Now using schedule_full_refresh() and PAK loader fixes applied [Nate Woods]

- KAYPRO: Keyboard fixed [Juergen Buchmueller]

- PCW16: emulation is fully working. To run this you need the "OS rescue disk". The system
  rom is contained on the OS rescue disc and you will need this to install the OS. This
  disc is available on the net, do a search to find it. [Kev Thacker]

- PC: improved PC-AT keyboard emulation to work with PCW16. Should work better with PC
  emulation too.  Improved PC-Serial Mouse emulation to work with PCW16, improved PC FDC
  emulation to work with PCW16. FDC now works as before but uses same nec765 code as the
  Amstrad and Spectrum drivers. More software that programs the FDC directly should work.
  Changed PIO code in PC-XT to use 8255 emulation. Seperated PC-LPT code to be used with
  PCW16. seperated and improved PC-Serial code. Works with PCW16 now, and interrupts are
  set/cleared correctly. seperated pc floppy disc handling code for use with PCW16.
  Fixed tandy1000 problem, pc's changed to use pckeybrd, split pc_cga, pc_mda, pc_t1t from
  pc and fixed atcga, xtvga init/blink problems.  changed uart8250 and pc_mouse interface,
  realtime clock fixes and improvements (starts with current time) better vga retrace
  emulation, fixed mouse problem in pc's (was a simple inputport configuration problem)
  [Kev Thacker, Peter Trauner]

- SPECTRUM: The border displaying code is now includes a full refresh flag. 128K port
  decoding updated (still not exact on +3) - Sound now works on Zub 128K.
  [David Robertson]

- A7800: TIA sound update, which replaced the fixed/rand() polynome initializations to
  ones based on the same algorithms that are used in the Pokey driver.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- TRS80: Split the ROMs into the 4K sizes they originally had
  trs80.rom -> trs80.z33, trs80.z34 and trs80.zl2
  sys80.rom -> sys80rom.1 sys80rom.2 and sys80rom.3
  added an trs80alt driver for the 'R/S L2 BASIC' (its an original ROM with a shorter
  bootstrap message and some code modifications). IO_CASSETTE now only loads *.cas files in
  SYSTEM format and IO_QUICKLOAD is used for files in *.cmd format (disk excerpts)
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Commodore: m65ce02/m4510 timing corrected, fixed rtn, plp, rti, eom, added m65ce02 aug
  c65 speed improvements, ega/vga speed improvements [Peter Trauner]

- AMSTRAD: Changed video hardware code to use 6845 CRTC code.  Also added Eventlist code to
  the Amstrad video hardware code. It will record colour changes, mode changes and crtc
  register writes.  This means support for multi-modes on the same screen, colour changing
  effects, and demos. There is a second method which updates between I/O writes that
  would affect the screen. The rendering method can be chosen with a compile switch.
  Also added correct opcode timings for Amstrad using new cpu_setcycletable, this
  means raster effects are now correct. Also added emulation of the Multiface hardware.
  It requires a rom (optionally loaded). You must enable it in the dipswitches. When
  enabled F1 will be the "stop" button. [Kev Thacker]

- ZX: Fixed ZX80 palette: it's black on white, and not viceversa. [Stefano Priore]

- CoCo/Dragon: Fixed a bug the CoCo 3 horizontal scroll so Crystal City is partially
  playable now, converted the CoCo/Dragon driver to use an include file, moved PAK loading
  code into a new src/mess/formats directory [Nate Woods]

- PDP/1: Fixed a null pointer access if no image is loaded. [Nate Woods]

- PC1401/1402/1350: Artwork support added [Peter Trauner]

- PCW: Added sound emulation. [Kev Thacker]

- PCW/CPC/SPECTRUM: Fixed some bugs in the disk image handling code used in
the Amstrad CPC, Amstrad PCW, and Spectrum+3 drivers [Kev Thacker]


Other Changes:
--------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.37b5. This incorporates all
  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team]

- NEC765: improved and more commands added, supports DMA access. Can handle
  images with copyprotection. A lot more software should now run on the
  systems that use it (PCW,Spectrum, Amstrad,PC and PCW16). [Kev Thacker]

- 6522via Bug fix [Gordon Jefferyes]

- Optional ROM support. It can be used in MESS for BIOS ROMs for peripherals for which
  you'd like to provide a valid crc32 without requiring the ROM. [Brad Oliver]

- Imgtool: Added a CRC command to imgtool so output image information in .crc format
  basename()'s the command name when printing error info, Fixed a typo in the usage
  examples, added a very rough imgtool.txt to document imgtool [Nate Woods]

- Added new endian macros [Nate Woods]

- DeviceIO bug fixed for most drivers [Juergen Buchmueller]

  To load tape images from Basic, type "LOAD", wait for the program to load, press space,
  then RUN, LIST, etc. Some images should be loaded from the monitor, asteroids,
  asteroids+ and scramble. When in the monitor, press L and wait for the program to load
  and run. [Paul Daniels]

- NASCOM: Tidy up palette code. Nascom1 tape load. Memory config. 1Kb, 16Kb, 32Kb, 40Kb at

  the tools (dat2html, imgtool, etc) [Nate Woods]
  added a info function (info is showed before the file listing in the dir command), added
  extract command to allow conversion between file formats with create and extract
  functions, added stream_clear to clear files (fopen(...,"w+")), added some parameters to
  the create and put commands, c64crt c64 cartridge file support, more for professional
  use (c64 cartridge dumper) and t64 c64 tape format support. [Peter Trauner]

- Implemented a new palette in tms9928a, computed from TI datasheet.  [Raphael Nabet]

- Cassette/wave code: Adds the ability to mute the cassette audio output.  This is done
  by setting bit 1 of the device status.  [Nate Woods]

  used - this now means they appear on Tape Control menu, corrected clock speed of
  TS2068, fixed Issue 2/3 dipswitch implementation, dipswitch to enable/disable disk
  drives on +3 and clones (disabling disk drives on +3 correctly shows machine as +2a
  on start up menu). implemented TS2068/TC2048 64 column and hires modes, rewrote
  Spectrum 128 screen refresh to use plot_pixel for a major speedup.
  Fixed bug that created a new file if trying to use a non-existant .TAP file, modified

- CoCo/Dragon/MC-10: Better .CAS file support, now supports cassette writes,
  slightly better .PAK file support. [Nate Woods]

- CoCo: Now uses the standard wd179x code.  As a result, src/mess/machine/cocodisk.c
  is not necessary anymore, implemented 63.5usec horizontal sync interrupt
  (Dragon/CoCo/CoCo 3), implemented secondary fire buttons for both joysticks
  (Dragon/CoCo/CoCo 3), keyboard interrupt (CoCo 3). [Nate Woods]

- CBM: cbm floppy drive simulation names for file system access changed, floppy disk
  simulation for pet series (not working with first pet and superpet), added 8096 memory

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- PC: Mouse now very usable, PC CGA scrolling support in 320x200x2 fixed
  (Boulderdash), Tandy1000 Graphics memory switching enchanced (Lemmings),
  Joystick changes (slow autocenter remaining), added xtcga with mf2 keyboard
  and turbo switch, split the xtvga in xtega (vga with ega monitor), and added
  palette handling to ega/vga. [Peter Trauner]

- C364: preliminary speech added (similar hardware in the C64
  cartridge Magic Voice, used in few programs). [Peter Trauner]

- C128: Esc-x to switch c128 to 40 column mode. Keypad enter to switch
  emulator to 40 column mode. In the input keys configuration menu you
  should find several key assignments with normal (not reversed)T.  Change
  these to another key, and the normal T will work. (in the system file
  these keys are disabled, until I find a better solution) [Peter Trauner]

- MACPLUS: driver boots (must use the 68k C core) [Nate Woods]

- SEGA MASTER SYSTEM: Rewrite of the SMS video code, so quite a lot of games with
  interrupt problems or corrupt graphics run fine now. [Charles MacDonald]

- SPECTRUM: Added support for 128K .SNA and .Z80 files, ensured that the 48K Basic
  ROM is paged in when running 48K snapshots on 128K machine (for improved
  reliability and access to the default character set), changed +3 initialisation,
  128 and +3 now set 0x4000-0x7fff to bank 5 (Now not changed if switching to shadow
  screen), cleaned up spectrum_plus3_update_memory, fixed bug in decoding uncompressed
  v2+ .Z80 files, and changed running speed of 128K Machines to 3.54690MHz
  [David Robertson]

- COMMODORE: cbmdrive (memory freeing) fixed, cia6526 tod fix, c128fra fix,
  50 hertz machines now really have 50 hz video refresh, c16 1551 simulation fixed
  [Peter Trauner]

- DRAGON series: Now supports a new variant of the .PAK file format for snapshots.
  [Nate Woods]

- TI99:  Mini Memory Support (rename minimemc.bin to minimemm.bin for it to
  work correctly), fixed a bug in banked roms when a hard reset (F3) is done, rom
  images are now identified by their filename extensions (image order isn't important
  anymore), no need to use NUL when no grom image, both alt -> fctn and both ctrl -> ctrl
  added, and new rom image extensions (.c .d .m .g .crom. drom. mrom .grom).
  [Norberto Alfredo Bensa]

- A7800: Support for bankswitched carts and carts with extra RAM, added 160B video mode,
  increased screen height to fix clipping at bottom, updated header format (details can be
  found in machine/a7800.c), added support for light gun trigger (not the light gun
  targetting yet, just the trigger), and removed requirment for a cartridge (since the 7800
  starts in the BIOS it doesn't technically need a cartridge) [Dan Boris]




Other Changes:
--------------

- The core is based on MAME 0.37b2. This incorporates all
  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team]

- TOOLS: Disk Utility added (mkhdimg.exe) which will create variable sized HD images
  for use in MESS.  Can create images from 9,216 bytes to 142,606,848 bytes
  without problems.  The Western Digital 1004A that is emulated in MESS is
  limited to 1024 Cylinders and 16 heads. The sector size is limited to 512
  bytes as well as the sectors per track being limited to 17, this is also
  due to the WD1004A's limitations. [Randy Rains]

- TOOLS: Generic image tool added (imgtool.exe) with the following features:
  *MAME/MESS style driver architecture; where the image formats are contained in drivers.
   Currently, the only driver is for CoCo .DSK disk images, but there could be more.
  *Runs on the command line.
  *Commands for listing image contents, retrieving and storing files.
  *Supports images in .ZIP files.
  *"Engine" is separate from the "shell"; which gives the potential for front ends for
   those who don't like command lines. [Nate Woods]

- Disk write support for AMSTRAD CPC [Oscar Martín González]

- Wave timer fix [Oscar Martín González]

- m6510t/m7501/m8502 CPU cores added [Peter Trauner]

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- Apple2 driver keyboard fix 	 [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Apple2 driver changed to use 'normalized' character and graphics
  layout.  The scanlines are now done by the hosts video code.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- ColecoVision Video refresh fixed. [Sean Young]

- Adjusted timing of NES clock to be accurate. [Brad Oliver]

- Preliminary Mockingboard support for the Apple II. [Brad Oliver]

- Genesis sound improvements. [Gareth Long]

- Several drivers have had compatibility improved (eg. NES, Genesis and Coleco)

- The Apple II drivers have been fleshed out a little more. The //e
  family now works. The disk emulation is significantly faster as well.
  There is still plenty of work to be done though. [Brad Oliver]

- Bug fixes to the TI9928a video code. This affects the ColecoVision and the
  TI-994a drivers. [Raphael Nabet, Sean Young]

- NES psg frequency is now correct. [Brad Oliver]

- Genesis now features preliminary FM sound. [Gareth Long, Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Increased Genesis compatibility. [Gareth Long]

- Memory allocation fix in the NES driver [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Commodore SID emulation!  [Peter Trauner]


Other Changes:
--------------

- [DOS] Images specified at the command line must now be accompanied by the device they
  are to be attached to, and will not be loaded unless the device is specified *and*
  supported by that system.  Eg, to attach a cartridge for the NES, you must specify:
  MESS nes -cart galaga.nes
  This may affect the usage of frontends, however it brings the MESS command line
  into sync with the well accepted MAME convention for command line usage.  See mess.txt
  for options and usage.

- Added support to automagically append or replace extensions for files
  opened with image_fopen(), which means, if opening a given filename
  fails (also from the optional clone_of parent driver), the code replaces
  or appends the next available extension and tries again.   Therefore, there
  is no need to actually supply the file extension to the command line.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- The core is based on MAME 0.36 final. This incorporates all
  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team]

- New option -listdevices. Use this to obtain valid device names for use at the command
  line to attach images to the system.

- Extensive CRC updates.
  [Sean Young, Chris Henry, Gerardo Jorrin, Peter Trauner, Cowering]
  SysInfo.dat documentation update
  [Thierry Schimbi, Chris Henry, Kev Thacker, Raphael Nabet]

  (battlepriest@hotmail.com).

- Small bug in the 6522 emulator fixed. [Gordon Jefferyes]

- Important inclusions for this release:
  *wave sound interface and IODevice handler
  *speaker sound driver (replaces the buzzer code)
  *preliminary file manager
  *mess_printf() which checks for gui_host
  Check the UI (TAB) for handling options for most of the above.

- Generic M6847 code  [Nate Woods]

- Wd179x disk access update.  The correct sector size is now
  calculated for the nec765 real FDD access.  Now it is calculated
  from sector size. Loading from real disc works on Enterprise
  emulator.  [Kev Thacker]

- void via_set_clock(int which,int clock); added to 6522via.c.  This
  can be called after via_config() to change the clock, otherwise the
  clock speed of CPU1 is used. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

- mess/msdos.c & mess/msdos.h created for MESS DOS specific functions.
  Note: Each port is now responsible for handling these functions.


- GAME_ALIAS flag added.  Use this when specifying a clone system
  which requires the same romset as another. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- System documentation is now contained in sysinfo.dat and
  sysinfo.htm.  Use dat2html to generate sysinfo.htm from sysinfo.dat
  [Chris Henry, Juergen Buchmueller, Ben Bruscella]

- You can now specify switches on the commandline in which case every
  image name following them goes to that respective slot, regardless
  of it's extension.  See mess.txt for some examples
  [Peter Trauner, Juergen Buchmueller]

- [DOS] New options for IMAGES to be opened, namely OSD_FOPEN_READ,
  OSD_FOPEN_WRITE, OSD_FOPEN_RW, and OSD_FOPEN_RW_CREATE.  Check
  mess.h for a description of what they are used for.  Be sure to use
  these semantics when handling read/write files.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]
- slight changes to the PDP1 driver.

- [DOS] TI99 keyboard fix! [Raphael Nabet]

- System ROM (Image) name matched from CRC database file on startup.
  (file stored in CRC directory)

- You can now specify in MESS.CFG the *exact* directory a rom is
  which you want to run.  no longer necessray to have a directory with
  the same name as the system [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Zipped cart and image support added. To use, make sure that the zip has the
  same name as the file in the zip. (eg) for a coleco CART called
  "venture.rom", zip to "venture.zip".  When running MESS, type "mess coleco
  venture.rom".  MESS will then load "venture.rom" from "venture.zip".  Any
  system roms can also be zipped and placed anywhere in you ROMPATH. (eg)
  coleco.rom in coleco.zip.
  [Ben Bruscella]

- GAME_COMPUTER flag added.  Use this to specify that the system requires
  full keyboard emulation.  Emulated Computer systems now use the
  scroll_lock key to toggle the keyboard emulation.  When on, MAME keys
  (such as "P" for pause) are disabled, until toggled with the scroll_lock.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]


- [DOS] MAKEFILE/compilation changes. To compile MESS, simply make sure you
  can compile MAME. Then, apply the MESS source over-ride and:

   1. Rename MAKEFILE to MAKEFILE.mm
   2. Rename MAKEFILE.MES MAKEFILE
   3. Type MAKE


- There have been major changes to the Driver structures and loading procedure.

*Here is an overview:

* Every game driver's struct GameDriver (src/mess/systems/*.c) is now
defined using one of four macros COMP/COMPX or CONS/CONSX.
COMP is for computers and CONS is for consoles. The X versions allow
specifying additional flags (GAME_NOT_WORKING ect.)

* Every game driver specifies it's peripherals in an array of
"struct IODevice" elements.

* rom_load and rom_id fields were moved into that list, together with
the number of devices and the known file extensions for images of that
type.

* MAME's src/driver.h now only contains one pointer to this list of
devices, all of MESS' extra fields are gone.
Old:
#ifdef MESS
    int (*rom_load)(void);
    int (*rom_id)(const char *name, const char *gamename);
    const char **file_extension;
    int num_of_rom_slots;
    int num_of_floppy_drives;
    int num_of_hard_drives;
    int num_of_cassette_drives;
#endif

New:
#ifdef MESS
    const struct IODevice *dev;
#endif


* The global rom_name[], floppy_name[], hard_name[] and cassette_name[]
arrays are gone! Instead each machine driver (src/mess/systems/*.c)
should specify an init function for every device it supports.
This init function is called during the startup with an id (0 to max
instances of the device - 1) and a filename.

* rom_load is called very early when a driver is started.
It is the 'init' function for the device type IO_CARTSLOT, so the
previous statement applies here too.

* the rom_id function pointer moved into the struct IODevice too.
Every device can have a id function, so if it is possible to identify
eg. a floppy disk, harddisk, cassette ect., you should provide the
identifying functions and put them in this field in your systems/driver code.
The id function return value is sort of TRUE/FALSE, ie. non zero
means image is ok for this device, zero is not recognized.

* The IODevice contains an "void (*exit)(int id);" entry, so each
driver could (and probably should) handle shutting down the various
device instances.
The exit entries are called from src/mess/mess.c exit_devices(),
which is called from src/mame.c shutdown_machine().

* Startup handling moved from src/mame.c to src/mess/mess.c
In the first stage load_image() is called.
The images specified on the command line are parsed in mess.c now, and
a list of "struct ImageFile" entries in the GameOptions is set.
This struct contains a "char *name" and an "int type", where type should
be set to one of the IO_CARTSLOT, IO_FLOPPY ect. values.
GUI ports could use this to store some file selection lists together with
the type of files selected.
The DOS port stores image names from the command line (*argv) in this
array, and the type of image is determined this way:
1st: user specified a type using a switch before a (list of) name(s).
     For DOS this looks like "mess system -flop test -cart rom1 -cart rom2"
2nd: the extension of the filename matches one of the MessDevice entries
     of the driver which is started. So if a driver defines "cas" for
     it's IO_CASSETTE device and "dsk" for it's IO_FLOPPY device, the
     command line "mess driver a.dsk b.cas" will be sufficient.

* In the second stage during startup, the get_files() function is called
and images are sorted into some (static) arrays of names in mess.c.
This is to allow easier/faster access to them and maybe useful for
swapping the names and calling init_<device> again.

* The third stage now walks through the list of devices of the driver
which is to be started and calls it's init functions with the the
names from the arrays. If the driver returns non zero, the startup
process is terminated here.
