		<p class="topic">What makes <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> different from 
			other emulators?/Why yet another emulator?</p>
		<p>
			The main difference is that it supports many different kinds of computers and 
			consoles, not just one like most emulators. <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>
			is also open source, which means it's free and anyone who knows the C 
			programming language can help with the project. Also, <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a>' architecture makes it easy to add lesser known systems that no 
			one would care enough about to emulate and preserve otherwise. The main 
			difference, however, is the goals of the project. Most standalone emulators 
			have the goal of letting you play games for whatever system on your PC. Because 
			their main goal is playability, they often include speed hacks and fudge things 
			so that most games run fast but a few games won't work. <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a>' philosophy is to behave <u>exactly</u> like the original 
			hardware, even if it's incredibly slow, so that <u>all</u> software for the 
			original machine will work. This tends to make <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>
			a fair bit slower than other emulators, but this is not always true.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">Isn't <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> the same as <a href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</a>?</p>
		<p>
			No. <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> is based on <a href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</a>, and uses the same underlying engine, but its goals are different. 
			To put it simply, <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a> is for arcade 
			machines, and <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> is for home computers and 
			video game consoles.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">What's a BIOS?/What's a ROM?/What's a disk image?</p>
		<p>
			First, it is important to note that in the emulation world, the term ROM is 
			used to refer to two different things:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			The ROM chips within a computer system, that usually contain some form of BASIC 
			or the like
			<li>
				The ROM chips within a game cartridge for a console system</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			For the sake of clarity, the official MESS terminology for #1 is "BIOS", after 
			what they are typically called in Intel PC systems, and the term "ROM" is 
			avoided.&nbsp; The term "cartridge image" is used to refer to #2, where "image" 
			is a generic term that applies to downloaded images of removable media, whether 
			they be a cartridge, a floppy drive, or a hard disk.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">Where do I get BIOSes/ROMs?/How do I use my old software with <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a>?</p>
		<P></P>
		<p>
			In most cases, old software is physically incompatible with modern computers. 
			No matter how hard you push, an Atari cartridge just plain won't fit in your 
			computer's floppy drive. Folding up old 5 1/4" diskettes so they fit in a 3 
			1/2" drive will only break your disks. Obviously there's a problem here - how 
			do I get that software into my PC so an emulator can use it?
		</p>
		<p>
			It's possible to build special cartridge reading devices for console systems 
			and hook up old computers to new ones to transfer floppy disks. These media get 
			transferred into files on the new computer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, originally emulation was just for hobbyists who had all this special 
			equipment, but some of them put these BIOSes and images up on the Internet for 
			people to download, on the honor system that people would only download the 
			BIOSes and images that they owned the original software for. Unfortunately, a 
			lot of people came along who just wanted to download free games and didn't care 
			about preservation, and gave the emulation community a bad name among software 
			companies. There are many BIOSes/images sites on the Internet, using a search 
			engine should turn up the ones you want. But remember: downloading pirated 
			BIOSes/images that you don't own is illegal. Some people say that the 
			copyrights have expired or that you can download it if you delete it after 24 
			hours, but they are wrong. It's up to you whether you want to ignore the law, 
			as most of the games are not and will not ever be sold again.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most systems require BIOSes. <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> is very 
			picky about its BIOSes -- they must be exactly the ones it is expecting, 
			otherwise it will complain and probably won't work.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">Okay, I got some BIOSes and images, now where do I put them?</p>
		<p>
			BIOSes should go, still zipped, in the BIOS subfolder of wherever you put <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a>. Game images should go into the SOFTWARE\[system name] folder. 
			They can still be zipped, but only one image per zip file.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">All right, I did all that, now how do I run <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a>?</p>
		<p>
			It depends on what version you have. For DOS, type "mess [system] [game] 
			[options]", where system is the system abbreviation, game is the filename of 
			the ROM, and options are command line options listed in the readme.txt and 
			mess.txt files. For UNIX/Linux, do the same thing except the name of the 
			program is xmess. For Windows and Macs, just run the program and click on the 
			systems and games you want to run--it's pretty easy. If it asks you for your 
			soundcard, choose Sound Blaster or Windows Sound System. Most people don't have 
			those other ones.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">I did everything just like you said, but it still doesn't work!</p>
		<p>
			There is a messageboard you can go to for help at <a href="http://www.mess.org/">http://www.mess.org</a>. 
			But first, make sure you read this FAQ and the rest of the documentation. The 
			answers can often be found there. Also check out the <a href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</a> FAQ at <a href="http://www.mame.net/">http://www.mame.net</a> --it's 
			a very good resource for things common to <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a>
			and <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>, such as sound and graphics setup. 
			Also search through the messageboard to see if somebody already had the same 
			problem. And at least put some effort into fixing it yourself. People on 
			messageboards can get very annoyed with people who ask questions that have 
			already been answered elsewhere, especially in readme.txt and mess.txt.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">It works, but it's way too slow!</p>
		<p>
			Because of <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>' goal of compatibility over 
			speed, this is often the case. You might think that your computer should be 
			able to emulate such old machines at full speed, but keep in mind that <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a> is not performing any shortcuts in the emulation. Many other 
			emulators perform shortcuts that sacrifice compatibility in favor of 
			performance, which is a valid tradeoff given a different set of design goals. 
			With <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>, your CPU is doing the jobs of the 
			CPU(s), graphics chip(s), sound chip(s), as well as any other special hardware 
			present in the original machine, so it can be bogged down fairly easily, 
			especially by the relatively unoptimized <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>
			core. <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> is written almost entirely in C, 
			not assembly, for compatibility reasons. Additionally, there is a level of 
			overhead required to get the level of modularity that it takes to have the 
			myriad components in the emulation be usable across a broad set of drivers. 
			There are some tweaks you can do to speed up the performance a bit (see the <a href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</a> FAQ), but if you need a big boost, there's not much you can do 
			except buy a faster computer, wait for an update (not likely), or use another 
			emulator.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">Why don't <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> and <a href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</a> merge?</p>
		<p>
			Although the people involved in developing new versions of both programs are 
			enthusiasts working out of love for the systems involved, the systems are 
			essentially different. Arcade games, which <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a>
			specializes in, are usually unique, in that the hardware for any particular 
			game was a one-time solution arrived at in order to get the game to market. 
			Some game companies, such as SNK, Nintendo and others, did develop systems that 
			could be changed over to play other games relatively easily, but this wasn't 
			the rule in the arcades. To emulate an arcade game, the programmer develops a 
			driver file which mimics hardware surrounding the arcade game's CPU or CPUs. 
			Both <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a> and <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>
			contain the same cores to emulate the same CPUs. <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>' 
			focus is accurate emulation of the hardware of computer and gaming consoles, 
			hardware which doesn't change depending on which game or program is being run. 
			Fundamentally, <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A> &nbsp;and <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a> are being created by and are targeted for slightly different 
			segments of the emulation community: gamers and vintage computer enthusiasts. 
			Those two communities do often times overlap, and a merger of the two programs 
			is theoretically possible at some point in the future.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">Why doesn't <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> split into two 
			versions, one for consoles and one for computers?</p>
		<p>
			Why isn't there a program called MASS to mimic mainframes? So far it hasn't 
			seemed necessary to split <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>&nbsp;into two 
			programs. The core program inherited on a regular basis from new updates of <A href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</A>&nbsp;can accommodate a large number of systems. If you think of 
			each arcade game in&nbsp;<A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A> as a separate 
			computer or console, the latest version has over 3,000 different machines 
			available, compared to <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>' hundreds of 
			systems listed under its All Systems menu. The border dividing gaming consoles 
			from computers tends to blur the further back you go in time. Is Nippon 
			Electric Company's PC Engine a game or a computer? Coleco orignally marketed 
			its Adam computer as an add-on to the Colecovision gaming system. Nintendo also 
			had big plans to turn its NES and later SNES into full-fledged computers 
			delivering information and services to users over an early version of the 
			internet. The APF Imagination Machine was also built around a game console 
			core. Atari's line of computers grew out from its original gaming console, and 
			were probably used more for gaming in their day than any serious computing 
			projects. The simple answer is there's still a lot of room for&nbsp;<A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>
			to include new gaming consoles and computers. The complicated answer is that 
			it's hard to tell the difference.
		</p>
		<p class="topic">I fail to understand your emphasis on "pure" hardware emulation; 
			what does that mean?&nbsp; Does this mean that you will or will not implement 
			feature XXXXX?</p>
		<p>Obviously, this depends on what XXXXX is.&nbsp; Both <A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A>&nbsp;and
			<A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>&nbsp;go by an idea that the emulation 
			should be "pure".&nbsp; Pure can be taken in any number of ways; in one sense, 
			a truly pure emulation would be a gate level simulator that tried to track the 
			state of every gate in the system.&nbsp; We don't go for that because that 
			would be impractical.&nbsp; When we say "pure", we mean that we emulate all 
			CPU(s) instruction by instruction and clock cycle by clock cycle and try to 
			make the hardware look "authentic" from the perspective of the CPU(s).&nbsp; As 
			long as that condition is satisfied, we are generally willing to implement 
			anything.&nbsp; Features like anything external to the emulation itself, such 
			as image file formats and UI fall in that category.&nbsp; This approach 
			constasts with the High Level Emulation (HLE) approach taken by <a href="http://www.uni-mainz.de/~bauec002/B2Main.html">
				Basilisk II</a> and <a href="http://www.emuunlim.com/UltraHLE/">UltraHLE</a>, 
			where BIOS and/or OS routines are patched and the actual hardware is bypassed 
			for either speed or convenience reasons.</p>
		<p class="topic">Why don't you support a feature that allows the user to remap 
			their keyboard to the emulated system's, eliminating the need to adjust to the 
			system's keyboard layout?</p>
		<p>We are working on this feature; the paste feature in <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>
			&nbsp;0.62 laid the foundation for this feature. Sit tight</p>
		<p class="topic">Your file manager is an abomination in the eyes of 
			God/Allah/Jehovah/Budda/Zoroaster/anyone with an ounce of sense!</p>
		<p>
			We hear your cries. We hate the thing too. For the moment we are stuck with it, 
			but we are trying to phase it out.
