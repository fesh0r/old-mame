		<h1>System Requirements</h1>
		<p>
			The Windows version of MESS runs on Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 
			ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP. Ensure the latest version of 
			DirectX is installed. NT4 users will need SP4 or greater. If Internet Explorer 
			4.0 or higher has never been installed, the MESS GUI will need the common 
			controls update. This will prevent property sheet errors when going to the 
			Properties tabs for individual games or the Options • Default Options menu 
			item.
		</p>
		<P>
			Because of the wide range of arcade hardware supported by MESS, system 
			requirements vary considerably. Early arcade games circa 1984 and before can be 
			run on Pentium/2/3 level boxes with 64M of memory. However, the more complex 
			the original arcade hardware, the more CPU power is needed to emulate it. More 
			recent games can often take upwards of 512M of memory, and AMD Athlon / Pentium 
			4 chips to emulate at 100% speed with effects. For those wishing to upgrade 
			their systems; MESS benefits most from adding more CPU power, then memory and 
			upgraded video card.
