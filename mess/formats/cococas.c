		 * so, they make the CoCo more tolerant of short headers and lack of
		 * delays between blocks.  This legacy is reflected in most CAS files
		 * in use, and thus presents a problem for a pure hardware emulation
		 * like MESS.
		 *
		 * One alternative is to preprocess the data on the CAS, file by file,
		 * but this proves to be problematic because in the process, legitimate
		 * data that is unrecognized by the preprocessor may get dropped.
		 *
		 * The approach taken here is a hybrid approach - it retrieves the data
		 * block by block until an error occurs; be it the end of the CAS or a
		 * corrupt (?!) block.  When "legitimate" blocks are done processing,
		 * the remainder of the data is added to the waveform in a traditional
		 * manner.  The result has proven to work quite well.
		 *
		 * One slight issue; strict bounds checking is not done and as such,
		 * this code could theoretically overflow.  However, I made sure that
		 * double the amount of required memory was set aside so such overflows
		 * may be very rare in practice
