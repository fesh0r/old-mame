<h1>How to compile MESS (Win32)</h1>
<p>
	<i>(Last updated 19-Apr-2002)</i>
</p>
<p>
	(This document is based on <a href="http://www.mame.net/compilewin.html">"How to
	compile MAME (Win32)"</a>.  Since the procedure for compiling MAME and MESS are
	virtually identical, these two documents are virtually identical)
</p>

<p>
	<b>Compiling means</b> rebuilding the actual executable program from its source code.
	MESS is almost fully written in C, with some assembler hacks in
	speed-critical places. The Win32 version of MESS is compiled with
	<a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>, which is the minimalist Win32
	port of a C compiler called <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> and its libraries.
</p>

<p>
	This particular how-to is written for MESS 0.56, but with a bit of luck you can 
	compile other versions with the help of this page. This how-to tells how to 
	compile the Win32 version of MESS, which includes both the command line and GUI versions.
</p>
					
<p>
	The MinGW development environment will be installed to <span class="filename">
		C:\MINGW</span> and MESS sources will be placed into <span class="filename">
		C:\MINGW\MESS</span>. Before beginning, you should make sure that you do 
	not have the directories <span class="filename">c:\mingw\</span>
	and <span class="filename">c:\download\</span> yet.
	
	If you do have them, rename them to another name or simply delete them (if you are sure that there
	aren't any important files in there).
</p>

<p>
				Remember, when you type commands into the command prompt, you should avoid 
				making typos <span class="fixedsize">;-)</span> In this how-to, 
				filenames and other static text are marked with the color <span class="filename">
					brown</span> and command lines or other information that you need to type 
				in are marked with the color <span class="command">green</span>.
<p>
				<hr>
				<b>1. Get Unzip</b>
<p>
				First of all, most files that are transferred over the Internet are compressed, 
				to minimize download times and bandwidth costs. You might already have a 
				Windows-based uncompressing utility, but since compiling MESS is done in a 
				command prompt, a different kind of utility is necessary. Download the 
				following file into the directory <span class="filename">
					c:\windows\command\</span> so that the
utility is accessible from any directory.
<p>
				<table width="100%" border="2" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5">
					<TR>
						<td><span><b>File&nbsp;name</b></span></td>
						<td><span><b>File&nbsp;size</b></span></td>
						<td><span><b>Description</b></span></td>
					</TR>
					<TR>
						<td><span><b><A href="http://www.mame.net/zips/compile/unzip.exe">unzip.exe</A></b></span></td>
						<td><span>140kB</span></td>
						<td><span>This is the <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/">Info-ZIP</a> uncompressing 
								utility called UnZip/NT v5.41.</span></td>
					</TR>
				</table>

<p>
				<hr>
				<b>2. Get MinGW</b>
<p>
				Then you need the MinGW files. Make a new directory, for example <span class="filename">
					c:\download\</span> and
download the following files into that directory. Note that there may be newer
versions of these files, but MESS is not verified to compile with any other
versions of the following files.

<p>
				<Table width="100%" border="2" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5">
					<TR>
						<td><span><b>File&nbsp;name</b></span></td>
						<td><span><b>File&nbsp;size</b></span></td>
						<td><span><b>Description</b></span></td>
					</TR>
					<TR>
						<td><span><A href="http://www.mame.net/zips/compile/mingw_for_mame.zip">mingw_for_mame.zip</A></span></td>
						<td><span>5517 kB</span></td>
						<td><span>This is the MinGW compile environment for use in Windows.</span></td>
					</TR>
				</table>

<p>
				<hr>
				<b>3. Uncompress MinGW</b>
<p>
				Next we will uncompress the MinGW files and set up some environment variables 
				so that MinGW is functional. Open up a command prompt. You can find it either 
				from under Start Menu - Programs, or you can simply select Run and type 
				command.com into the dialog box. When you have it open, type <span class="command">
					cd \download</span> and hit enter to change to the correct directory. After that,
type
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="command">unzip mingw_for_mame.zip -d c:\</span>
			<br>and hit enter to start uncompressing the MinGW files.
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>
				If you do not see the message "1 archive was successfully processed.", 
				re-download the archives. If you get a "Bad commmand or file name", verify once 
				again that you have <span class="filename">unzip.exe</span>
				in <span class="filename">c:\windows\command\</span>

<p>
				<hr>
				<b>4. Set up MinGW</b>
<p>
				Next we will have to set up the environment variables. To make the changes 
				permanent, we will have to edit <span class="filename">AUTOEXEC.BAT</span>, 
				which is a file that always gets run before Windows starts up. Type <span class="command">
					edit \autoexec.bat</span> and hit
enter. There might be a lot of things in there, so do not touch anything else
than what you are told to.
<p>
				Find the line which says something like <span class="filename">
					PATH C:\WIN98;C:\WIN98\COMMAND</span> (there might be some other 
				directories defined after these two). Add <span class="command">
					;C:\MINGW\BIN</span> to the end of that line, so that it will look like <span class="filename">
					PATH C:\WIN98;C:\WIN98\COMMAND</span><span class="command">;C:\MINGW\BIN</span>
				(again, there might be something extra in there, leave them as they are). Take 
				note that if you have added <span class="filename">C:\DJGPP\BIN</span>
				into that line, you should remove it. Now you can save the file (<span style="key">ALT-F</span>
				then <span style="key">S</span>) and quit (<span style="key">ALT-F</span>
				then <span style="key">X</span>) (These might differ depending on your language version of Windows). Then you will
need to reboot your computer, to make the changes effective.
<p>
				With systems that don't use startup files (such as Windows NT, 2000 or XP), you 
				can instead type <span class="command">edit 
					c:\mingw\mingw.bat</span> and write <span class="command">
					SET PATH=%PATH%;c:\mingw\bin</span> into it. You'll have to run this file 
				(simply type <span class="command">c:\mingw\mingw</span> to run it)
before being able to use MinGW.
<p>
				<hr>
				<b>5. Compile MESS</b>
<p>
				Now you can compile MESS. Download the source ZIP into <span class="filename">
					c:\download\</span>
<p>
				<Table width="100%" border="2" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5">
					<TR>
						<td><span><b>File&nbsp;name</b></span></td>
						<td><span><b>File&nbsp;size</b></span></td>
						<td><span><b>Description</b></span></td>
					</TR>
					<TR>
						<td><a href="http://homepage.eircom.net/~mess/mess056s.zip"><b>mess056s.zip</b></a><br></td>
						<td>2717 kB</td>
						<td>This is the source archive of MESS 0.56.</td>
					</TR>
				</table>
<p>
				Go to the download directory by typing <span class="command">
					cd \download</span> and uncompress the MESS sources by typing <span class="command">
					unzip mess056s.zip -d c:\mingw\mess\</span>.
<p>
				Then you can compile MESS. Type <span class="command">make -f makefile.mes</span>
				and hit enter. This will finally compile MESS itself. If you want to compile 
				the CPU optimized versions, type <span class="command">make -f makefile.mes 
					I686=1</span> or <span class="command">make -f makefile.mes K6=1</span>
				instead of just <span class="command">make -f makefile.mes</span>.
It will take a lot of time, ranging from 15 minutes to an hour depending on your
CPU speed, so go get yourself something to drink.
<p>
				When the compilation is done, you can type <span class="command">
					dir</span>. You should see a brand new <span class="filename">
					MESS.EXE</span> in there.
<p>
	You also need to make the INI file, by typing <span class="command">
	mess -cc</span> (an abbreviation of -createconfig).
<p>
Congratulations, you did it!
<p>
				<hr>
				<b>6. A new MESS appeared</b>
<p>
To successfully compile a new version of MESS, you should NOT uncompress a new set
of sources over an old version of MESS. Instead, rename the MESS directory to another
name or simply delete it totally (if you are sure that nothing important is there),
and then uncompress the new set of sources to an empty directory.
<p>
				<hr>
				<b>7. Then what..</b>
<p>
				Of course, the biggest advantage of building your own binary is the possibility 
				to tinker around with the source files. For example, to try out drivers which 
				are not fully working yet, take a look at the file <span class="filename">
					mess/system.c</span> with a normal text editor (like EDIT). The disabled 
				drivers are marked with the text TESTDRIVER. Simply remove the TEST part from a 
				driver you want to test, save the file and type <span class="command">
					make -f makefile.mes</span> again. Remember,
the license forbids you from redistributing binaries that contain systems which
are disabled in the official versions. Naturally, there should not be any reasons to redistribute
such binaries since this page makes it easy for everybody to build their own binaries.
<p>
				You might notice that the UPX part takes an obscene amount of time. The 
				simplest solution to avoid it is to just rename <span class="filename">
					upx.exe</span> to another name. If you do that, the make utility will give 
				you an error and the file <span class="filename">MESSDLIB.DLL</span> is
about 7 MB, but it will work fine.
<p>
				<hr>
				<b>8. Debug modes</b>
<p>
				To include the debugger functionality in your MESS executable, edit <span class="filename">
					makefile.mes</span>. Near the top you will see a text like "uncomment next line 
				to include the debugger". Remove the <span class="command">
					#</span> character from the next line, so that it only has <span class="filename">
					DEBUG = 1</span> in that particular line. Save the file, type <span class="command">
					make -f makefile.mes clean</span> and then <span class="command">make -f makefile.mes</span>. 
				To actually use the debugger, edit <span class="filename">
					MESS.INI</span> and find the line that says <span class="filename">
					debug = no</span>. Change it to <span class="filename">
					debug = </span><span class="command">yes</span> 
				and save the file. In MESS, hit tilde (&nbsp;<span style="key">~</span>&nbsp;) 
				or key to the left of the key &nbsp;<span style="key">1</span>&nbsp; 
				to enter the debugger.
