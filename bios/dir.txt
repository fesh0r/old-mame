All SYSTEM BIOS files (System ROMS) go in this Directory if they are 
zipped! ;-)

eg.  coleco.zip
     a7800.zip
     vectrex.zip

etc.....

If they are unzipped, place them in the systems subfolder:

eg.  bios\coleco
     bios\a7800
     bios\vectrex


(software) goes in the SOFTWARE subdirectory.
