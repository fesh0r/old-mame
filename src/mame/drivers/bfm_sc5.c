    Scorpion 5

    Skeleton Driver - For note keeping, no sets currently supported pending a better
     understanding of the system.

    Several sets have large roms, containing strings which mention Compact Flash cards
     - Are these CF card dumps
     - Should *All* games have them?
     - Do the Program roms just override parts of this, or do they work together?
