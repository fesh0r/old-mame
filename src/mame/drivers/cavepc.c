 Cave used a one-off PC platform for

 Deathsmiles II (c)2009

 According to
 http://forum.arcadeotaku.com/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=9851
 It uses a ASUS M3A78-EM motherboard (boot screen is shown)
 http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/M3A78EM/

 fitted with
 AMD Athlon 64 X2 5050e Brisbane 2.60GHz, 1024KB L2 Cache
 2048MB (2GB) 800MHz DDR

 and a custom JVS I/O board providing security etc.
 'CV2000XP Rev 2.0'

 The game is contained on a
 Transcend 2GB 300x UDMA Compact Flash Card
 plugged into an adapter board
 with 'Windows(r) Embedded Standard'

 There don't appear to be any dedicated video / sound boards so it
 presumably uses the onboard capabilities of the board
 'Integrated ATI Radeon(tm) HD 3200 GPU'
 'Realtek(r) ALC1200 8 -Channel High Definition Audio CODEC'

 There should be at least 3 game revisions?

 Pictures of the hardware can be seen at

 however this revision is using a Gigabyte motherboard instead, possibly
 different boards were used?
 appears to be this one
 http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3016#ov
 GA-MA78GPM-UD2H (rev. 1.0)

 The JVS board is said to be quite problematic, and the game will boot
 to an error screen if it isn't functioning correctly.
