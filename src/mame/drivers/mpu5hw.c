/* MPU5 hardware emulation */

/* This file contains the hardware emulation, the mpu5.c contains the set listings */

/*
    Many of the games in here also seem to exist on other hardware.

    MPU5

    Skeleton Driver

     -- there are a wide range of titles running on this hardware

     -- the driver does nothing, and currently only serves to act as a placeholder to document what existed on this hardware

     -- the main CPU is a 68340, which is a 32-bit 680xx variant with modified opcodes etc. (CPU32 core)

     -- Much of the communication is done via a 68681 DUART.

     -- Help wanted, the MFME sources (which are based on MAME anyway) should be of some help here, if somebody
        in the FM emu community wants to adopt this driver they're welcome to it.

     -- As a result of games being on multiple systems, and some of the original sets being a mess there could be one or two
        out of position here (eg MPU4 video instead of MPU5) or with missing roms if there was extra hardware (nothing has been
        removed from the rom loading comments, so if there were extra roms present they're still commented)

        Some duplicate roms have been commented out for now, please don't remove these lines until the sets are properly sorted.

        Some games weren't even in the right zips, Eg the Red Hot Fever (MPU4) cotnained a mislabled MPU5 'Raise The Roof' set
        with extra roms, probably actually from the MPU4 Red Hot Fever.  The game names are usually stored somewhat as plain
        ASCII so spotting such problems is easy enough.

        In general things have been added here if the rom structure and initial code looks like the MPU5 boot code



    15/07/11 - rom loading for most games added, still some missing tho and clones still need sorting out properly.
