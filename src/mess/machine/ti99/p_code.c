    TI-99 P-Code Card emulation.
    Michael Zapf, July 2009

    The P-Code card is part of the UCSD p-System support for the TI-99
    computer family. This system is a comprehensive development system for
    creating, running, and debugging programs written in UCSD Pascal.

    The complete system consists of
    - P-Code card, plugged into the Peripheral Expansion Box (PEB)
    - Software on disk:
      + PHD5063: UCSD p-System Compiler
      + PHD5064: UCSD p-System Assembler/Linker
      + PHD5065: UCSD p-System Editor/Filer (2 disks)

    The card has a switch on the circuit board extending outside the PEB
    which allows to turn off the card without removing it. Unlike other
    expansion cards for the TI system, the P-Code card immediately takes
    over control after the system is turned on.

    When the p-System is booted, the screen turns cyan and remains empty.
    There are two beeps, a pause for about 15 seconds, another three beeps,
    and then a welcome text is displayed with a one-line menu at the screen
    top. (Delay times seem unrealistically short; the manual says
    30-60 seconds. To be checked.)
    Many of the functions require one of the disks be inserted in one
    of the disk drives. You can leave the p-System by waiting for the menu
    to appear, and typing H (halt). This returns you to the Master Title
    Screen, and the card is inactive until the system is reset.

    The P-Code card contains the P-Code interpreter which is somewhat
    comparable to today's Java virtual machine. Programs written for the
    p-System are interchangeable between different platforms.

    On the P-Code card we find 12 KiB of ROM, visible in the DSR memory area
    (>4000 to >5FFF). The first 4 KiB (>4000->4FFF) are from the 4732 ROM,
    the second and third 4 KiB (>5000->5FFF) are from a 4764 ROM, switched
    by setting the CRU bit 4 to 1 on the CRU base >1F00.

    CRU base >1F00
        Bit 0: Activate card
        Bit 4: Select bank 2 of the 4764 ROM (0 = bank 1)
        Bit 7: May be connected to an indicator LED which is by default
               wired to bit 0 (on the PCB)

    The lines are used in a slightly uncommon way: the three bits of the
    CRU bit address are A8, A13, and A14 (A15=LSB). Hence, bit 4 is at
    address >1F80, and bit 7 is at address >1F86. These bits are purely
    write-only.

    Moreover, the card contains 48 KiB of GROM memory, occupying the address
    space from G>0000 to G>FFFF in portions of 6KiB at every 8KiB boundary.

    Another specialty of the card is that the GROM contents are accessed via
    another GROM base address than what is used in the console:
    - >5BFC = read GROM data
    - >5BFE = read GROM address
    - >5FFC = write GROM data
    - >5FFE = write GROM address

    This makes the GROM memory "private" to the card; together with the
    rest of the ROM space the ports become invisible when the card is
    deactivated.

    Emulation information:

    The P-Code card switch is mapped to a DIP switch in the configuration
    menu. If the switch is turned on, the system assumes that ROM dumps are
    present called "pcode_r0.bin" (4 KiB), "pcode_r1.bin" (8KiB),
    "pcode_g0.bin" (64 KiB). The switch is turned off by default. Check the
    switch position if the Master Title Screen does not appear as expected.
