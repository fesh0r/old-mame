    TI-99 Speech synthesizer

    We emulate the Speech Synthesizer plugged onto a P-Box adapter. The original
    Speech Synthesizer device was provided as a box to be plugged into the
    right side of the console. In order to be used with Geneve and SGCPU, the
    speech synthesizer must be moved into the Peripheral Box.

    The Speech Synthesizer used for the TI was the CD2501E, AKA TMS5200,
    (internal name TMC0285), a predecessor of the TMS5220 which was used in
    other commercial products.

    Note that this adapter also contains the speech roms.

    Comments on real timing in the TMS5200 emulation

    Real timing means that the synthesizer clears the /READY line (puts high)
    whenever a read or write access is in progress. This is done by setting
    /RS and /WS lines, according to the read or write operation. The /READY line
    is asserted again after some time. Real timing is used once the tms5220_wsq_w
    and tms5220_rsq_w are called.

    Within the TI systems, the /RS and /WS lines are controlled directly by the
    address bus. There is currently no way to insert wait states between
    the address setting and the data bus sampling, since this is an atomic
    operation in the emulator (read_byte). It would be necessary to somehow
    announce the pending read before it actually happens so that devices
    like this VSP may insert wait states before the read.

    The TMS5220 implementation assumes that wait states are respected and
    therefore delivers bad values when queried too early. It uses a latch that
    gets the new value after some time has expired.

    To fix this we have to modify the RS/WS methods in TMS5200 to immediately
    set the status (after updating the sound status, or the status will be
    outdated too early).

    Also note that the /RS and /WS lines must be cleared (put to high) when the
    read is done. Again, this is not possible with the current implementation.
    So we do this in the ready callback.

    On the bottom line we will stay with the not-REAL_TIMING for now and wait
    for the core to allow for split read accesses.
