<b><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">System Requirements</span></i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">MameUI runs on Microsoft Windows 98SE, Windows 
ME, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003 Server, Windows Vista, and Windows 7.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because of the wide range of arcade hardware supported by 
MameUI, system requirements vary considerably.&nbsp; The 
more complex the original arcade hardware, the more CPU power is needed to 
emulate it.&nbsp; Mame strives for accuracy in its emulation; as such, over 
time, the performance point shifts as the underlying engine has been reworked 
and refined.&nbsp; Early games now require a bit more PC processing power to run 
than they did in earlier versions of Mame.&nbsp; This is typically not a great 
concern as modern PCs can run these early games easily at thousands of times 
their original speed.&nbsp; More recent games can often take upwards of 512M of memory, and 
Phenom / Core2 chips to emulate at 100% speed with effects.&nbsp; For those 
wishing to upgrade their systems; <b>MameUI benefits most from adding more CPU 
power, using a 64bit build on a 64bit OS</b>, and then memory and upgraded video card.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Currently there are some games supported in MameUI which are not 
playable at full frame rate on today's PC hardware.&nbsp; Many of these are 
mid to late 90's and beyond advanced 3D games which MameUI renders in software for accuracy sake.&nbsp; 
Recent developments in Mame [.120] have allowed some of these games to get close 
to 100% playable on high-end overclocked [3.6Ghz+] Intel Core2Duo and Quad Core 
cpus.&nbsp; Additionally the fastest combination for MameUI is one of the 
previously mentioned CPUs plus the 64bit version of MameUI combined with a 64bit 
Operating System like Windows 7 x64.</p>
