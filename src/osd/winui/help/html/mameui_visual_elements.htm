<h2>MameUI Toolbar / Status Bar / Windows</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The MameUI <b>toolbar</b> extends the width of the application 
at the top and 
can be toggled on by using the View • Toolbar menu item, or the <b>Alt-T </b>keyboard 
shortcut.&nbsp; The buttons on the toolbar from left to right are : toggle folder 
list, toggle screenshot, large icons view, small icons view, list view, details 
view, help about, and help file.&nbsp; Click the items to toggle them on or off.&nbsp; 
The toolbar also contains the game search box, typing into this text box will 
filter out games.&nbsp; It is similar in function to the <strong>Ctrl-F</strong> filter but only 
filters on game descriptive name, it is also accessible with the <strong>Ctrl-E</strong> 
shortcut.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The MameUI <b>status bar</b> extends the width of the application 
at the bottom and can be toggled on by using the View • Status Bar menu item, or 
the <b>Alt-S</b> keyboard shortcut.&nbsp; The status bar indicates the full name of the game 
highlighted, and gives its internal status flag as to whether it’s working or if 
there are some issues with the emulation.&nbsp; The status bar also indicates the 
game count for the particular view used.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<img border="0" src="../images/statusbar.gif" width="632" height="20"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>MameUI can be divided into three windowed sections:</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first section on the far left is the <b>folder view</b>, 
toggled on by using the View • Folder List menu item, or the Alt-D keyboard 
shortcut.&nbsp; This contains a tree style list that expands for certain items like 
year, manufacturer, and custom.&nbsp; By selecting one of these items, MameUI will 
display the games that meet that criterion.&nbsp; For example: selecting year / 1978, 
MameUI will 
display all the supported games manufactured in 1978.&nbsp;  </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">MameUI will  display user 
created folders based on *.ini files located in the \MameUI\folders directory.&nbsp; 
See files in that location for examples.&nbsp; This location also houses the 
favorites.ini, where favorite games can be added to the text file and easily 
moved to other computers.<br>
&nbsp; </p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">MameUI supports dragging and dropping games from the middle 
section game list into a custom folder in the left pane.&nbsp; MameUI supports 
the same procedure by secondary clicking on the game in the game list and 
choosing the 'add to custom folder' option.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">MameUI also supports secondary clicking on a custom folder 
and renaming it, editing the custom folder name can also be accomplished by 
clicking the name of the folder three times quickly.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">Secondary clicking on any of the folders also allows 
selectively displaying or hiding them in the tree.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">Secondary clicking the vector folders and the \source\gamedriver 
folder allows for customizing 
away from default the games in that folder.<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; 
Secondary click on the vector folder • properties in the folder pane to set 
options for that group of games.&nbsp; To alter global settings for game 
families select the properties for it, e.g. dkong.c for the Donkey Kong family 
of games&nbsp; This will change options for 
all games based on that driver.&nbsp; Thus there is the possibility to have 
four levels of alterations when a game's individual properties are viewed 
in All Games or any folder.&nbsp; The changes can be backed out of 
hierarchically with reset to default on each respective properties, or by 
deleting the .ini files in the \ini directory.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">The second, middle section of MameUI is the <b>game list</b>, 
always toggled on. &nbsp;This is where MameUI lists all of the games chosen 
in the left folder view.&nbsp; MameUI has the option to display the games as large 
icons, small icons, a list icons view, or details.&nbsp; Choosing details allows 
MameUI to display, in columnar mode, the game name as well as additional 
informational fields, chosen in the View • Customize Fields menu item.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The third section, on the far right, is the <b>screenshot/art 
area</b>, toggled on by using the View • Screenshot menu item, or the <b>Alt-P</b> keyboard 
shortcut.&nbsp; This area of the GUI will display the optional artwork for each game 
selected, the artwork modes are toggled through by clicking on the picture area.&nbsp; The 
modes are: screenshot, flyer, cabinet, marquees,  title shots, control panels, 
and history.&nbsp; <b>Alt-B</b> 
will toggle the screenshot tabs which give a visual selection method besides 
clicking the artwork area.&nbsp; Secondary clicking on the screenshot area will 
also bring up a shortcut dialogue with the file types available and allow 
toggling on or off individual tabs.&nbsp; The area under the screenshot mode 
will also display the history.dat information if that file is present [it will 
not display in the screenshot area if the history tab is enabled].&nbsp; Each of 
the tabs can be navigated to by their accelerator keys, <b>Alt-1</b>, <b>Alt-2</b>,
<b>Alt-3</b>, etc. Further 
information about these files is in
