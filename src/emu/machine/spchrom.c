/*
    spchroms.c - This is an emulator for "typical" speech ROMs from TI, as used by TI99/4(a).

    In order to support its speech processor, TI designed some ROMs with a 1-bit data bus
    and 4-bit address bus (multiplexed 5 times to provide a 18-bit address).
    A fairly complete description of such a ROM (tms6100) is found in the tms5220 datasheet.

    One notable thing is that the address is a byte address (*NOT* a bit address).

    This file is designed to be interfaced with the tms5220 core.
    Interfacing it with the tms5110 would make sense, too.

        Create seperate devices for TMS6100 & TMS6125
        Implement the serial protocol
