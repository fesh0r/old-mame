Source Changes
--------------
Fixed long-standing bug with Emeralda text colors. A sprite 
attribute exists which signals an alternate interpretation of 
palette ram. Fixed priority for the bitmap layer used in Numan 
Athletics. [Phil Stroffolino]

Restructured input port internals and cleaned up inptport.c:
[Aaron Giles]

    * Input ports are now maintained hierarchically. At the top
      level are input ports, which contain a list of fields. Each
      field represents one or more bits of the port. Certain fields
      such as DIP switches and configuration switches contain a
      list of settings, which can be selected. DIP switch fields
      can also contain a list of DIP switch locations.

    * Normalized behavior of port overrides (via PORT_INCLUDE or
      by defining multiple overlapping bits). All fields within a
      port are kept in strict increasing bit order, so altered DIP
      switches are now kept in the appropriate order. This addresses
      MAMETesters bug 01671.

    * Live port state is now fully separate from configured 
      state. This is manifested in a similar way to devices, where
      a const list of ports can be managed either offline or live.
      Each port has a pointer to an opaque set of live state which
      is NULL when offline or valid when live. Each port also has
      a running_machine * which is also NULL when offline.

    * Because of this new arrangement, the conversion from tokens
      to a list of ports now requires reasonably complex memory
      allocation, so these port lists must be explicitly allocated
      and freed (they are not mantained by automatic resource
      allocation).

    * Custom and changed callbacks now take a pointer to a field
      config instead of a running machine. This provides more
      information about what field triggered the change notification.
      The machine can be found by referenced field->port->machine.

    * The inptport.c module has been cleaned up and many 
      ambiguities resolved. Most of this is internal, though it did
      result in osd_customize_inputport_list() being changed to
      osd_customize_input_type_list(). The parameter to this function
      is now a linked list instead of an array, and the structures
      referenced have been reorganized somewhat.

    * Updated config.c to pass machine parameters to its callbacks.

    * Updated validity checks, XML output, and UI system to handle
      the new structures.

    * Moved large table of default input settings to a separate
      include file inpttype.h.

    * Removed gross hacks in trackfld and hyperspt NVRAM. These
      may be broken as a result.

Further Namco NA-1 changes: [Phil Stroffolino]
 * Adjusted alternate palette handling weights to more accurately 
   match real hardware - text anti-aliasing is much more noticable.
 * Adjustment to roz layer priority - prevents roz layer from 
   incorrectly being displayed over backgrounds in some games (i.e. 
   numanathj)
 * Added a mask when processing the roz tilemap to avoid defects in 
   emeraldj

Fixed black pixel patches present in the TC0100SCN fg layer of 
undrfire and groundfx. [Philip Bennett]

Universal DRC system updates and improvements: [Aaron Giles]

   UML:
    * Added back-end validation mechanism, and a handful of tests as 
      examples. This will be expanded in the future.
    * Added several new opcodes:
       - SAVE dumps the entire virtual machine state to a struct
       - RESTORE applies the data in a struct to the live state
       - LZCNT counts leading zeros in an operand
       - XTRACT extracts a bitfield to another register (rlwinm)
       - INSERT inserts a bitfield into a register (rlwimi)
    * Added new back-end function get_info() which returns information 
      from the back-end about how many actual registers will be 
      mapped.

   x86 back-end:
    * Implemented all new opcodes.
    * Implemented get_info() function.
    * Fixed several bugs relating to shifts/rotates and optimizing out
      cases incorrectly.

   x64 back-end:
    * Implemented all new opcodes.
    * Implemented get_info() function.
    * Added defines for new Penryn opcodes to x86emit.h.
    * Added support for ROUNDSS and ROUNDSD on Penryn architectures. 
      This hasn't been tested. If you have a Penryn-based system, 
      give it a try.
    * Fixed several bugs relating to shifts/rotates and optimizing out
      cases incorrectly.
   
   C back-end:
    * Implemented all new opcodes.
    * Implemented get_info() function.
    * Cleaned up operand sizing.
    * Fixed several errors that made it not work on bigendian systems

   MIPS DRC:
    * Added some instrumentation for the MMU. To enable it, turn on 
      PRINTF_MMU at the top of the file.
    * Fixed front-end so that virtual no-op instructions are still 
      targeted as branch targets.
    * Fixed front-end to mark the beginning of each sequence as 
      needing TLB validation, since any sequence can be jumped to 
      from anywhere.
    * Redid the MIPS3 TLB implementation. Fixed the exception vector 
      and type handling. Changed the bitfields to directly map from 
      the MIPS TLB format. Added distinction between TLB fill and TLB 
      valid/modified exceptions.
    * Added separate modes for user, supervisor, and kernel modes. 
      Each mode does proper verification of addresses now and 
      generates address errors for invalid accesses.
    * Fixed several bugs in the TLB implementation; not everything 
      works yet but it's a lot closer.
    * Made COP0 access checking mandatory in non-kernel modes.
    * Fixed several crashes when recompiling virtual no-ops.
    * Fixed TLB bug where entries for virtual address 0 were present 
      by default.
    * Fixed bug in the map variable implementation that would 
      sometimes result in incorrectly recovered values.
    * Implemented IDT instructions. All invalid instruction asserts 
      are now runtime-only.
    * Added support to map a few common registers to machine registers 
      if the machine supports it. Currently only x64 on Windows has 
      enough free registers to do so, though PowerPC will almost
      certainly be able to take advantage of this. Gives a minor 
      speedup.
    * Updated to use INSERT and XTRACT where appropriate.
    * Cleaned up register usage to free up one machine register for
      x64 on Linux.
  
Added World Rally wheel support. [Mirko Mattioli]

Fixed spikes91 sprite colours without resorting to hacks.
[David Haywood]

Fixed N64 rendering on big-endian targets. [R. Belmont]

Fixed CDP1869 character memory access, and Cidelsa sprite flashing.
[Curt Coder]

Fixed 80286 databus widths. [Wilbert Pol]

Added proper interpolation sub-cycles to the TMS5110 and TMS5220 
('PC' cycles and A/B subcycles of each) and updated comments. 
[Lord Nightmare]

Fixed World Rally MCU comms on big-endian. [R. Belmont]

Changed defaults so that joysticks are enabled standard. [Aaron Giles]

Some improvements to Sandii' games: [Roberto Fresca, f205v]
 - Confirmed the CPU clock after some PCB measurements.
 - Changed the SND clock to 1MHz to match the PCB measurement.
 - Corrected the internal OKI6295 frequency turning the pin 7 state to HIGH.
 - Inputs: Eliminated all pulse limitations.
   Affected buttons have a rattled sound in the real thing too.
 - Updated technical notes.

Corrected several bugs in the emulation of the saturn CPU. These 
corrections are needed to make new HP48 drivers (to be submitted to 
MESS imminently) work. [Antoine Mine]

Eliminated a large number of global Machine references. Added machine
parameters to IRQ callbacks throughout the system to help remove
more. Reduced the number of files needing deprecat.h by ~200.
[Atari Ace]

Some work on lwings.c: Input clean up, added dip locations, fixed 
lwingsb life DIP switches, and merged machine drivers. [Sonikos]

Updated Gorf sample volume to match new samples from Chris Law.
[Chris Law]

Added built-in overlay for Moon Shuttle. [Deacon Blue]

01795: [Misc.] tm, tm3k, tm4k, tm5k, tm7k: Day on clock doesn't work
       (Luigi30)
01717: [DIP/Input] arcadecl, sparkz: Service Key mapped twice. 
       (stephh)
01713: [DIP/Input] spaceg: All joystick/buttons mapped twice. Button 1 
       is mapped 3 times! (stephh)
01791: [DIP/Input] asterock: Unable to credit up or play the game. 
       Also, there are discrete sound issues. (Fabio Priuli)

Source Changes
--------------
Improved cbombers sprites [Philip Bennett]

Renamed ports and used AM_READ_PORT macros in arcadecl. [stephh]

Add feature to the cia6526: in READ operation the value can be forced 
by a external circuit; this feature is necessary for MESS. [robiza]

undrfire.c improvements: [Philip Bennett]
 * Hooked up cbombers steering wheel input.
 * Changed ES5505 clock rate to 30476100/2.
 * Unified cbombers memory maps and tidied up some code.
 * Removed the undrfire speedup hack.

Marked the sound roms on Q*Bert's Qubes as bad and changed the flag to 
imperfect sound. The current sound cpu roms are the same as on a 
normal Q*Bert board, which is incorrect. At least three sound effects 
are present in the real qq-snd roms but not the Q*Bert qb-snd ones.
[Lord Nightmare]

Fixed the ROZ effect in Namco NA1 driver. ROZ tilemap is actually an 
additional tilemap. Fixes a bug where a "roz enable" test was causing 
a normal layer to be rendered with ROZ effects in-game. There is no 
roz enable register - it's always available for mixing with other 
tilemaps and sprites. This also adds a missing NAMCO logo zoom/spin 
effect in Emeralda's attract mode. [Phil Stroffolino]

Added memory address parameter to CDP1802 DMA callbacks, and added a 
macro for the CPU interface. [Curt Coder]

Rewrote the Gaelco video ram encryption, which finally makes sense.
The key observation was that when decrypting the second word, both 
encrypted and decrypted bits of the first word are used. Many thanks 
to Javier Valero for the detailed information that made this possible.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed coin inputs, added validator input, and added notes on inputs to
the tmaster driver. [Luigi30]

Merged memory maps for drivers: tagteam, tail2nos, tankbatt, tankbust, 
taotaido, targeth, and taxidrvr. [Andrew Gardner]

New driver for old Game-A-Tron gambling games hardware. 
[Roberto Fresca]
 - Properly decoded graphics.
 - Proper memory map.
 - Added NVRAM support.
 - Proper Inputs through 8255 PPI I/O chip.
 - Both games are working.
 - Added technical & game notes.

New universal dynamic recompiler system: [Aaron Giles]

    The central module is drcuml.c, which defines a universal 
    machine language syntax that can be generated by a frontend 
    recompiler and then retargeted via a generic backend 
    interface to any of a number of different architectures. A 
    disassembler for the UML is also included to allow 
    examination of the generated UML code.

    Currently supported backend architectures include 32-bit x86,
    64-bit x86, and a platform-neutral interpreted C backend that
    can be used as a fallback for platforms without native 
    support. The C backend also performs additional validation
    to ensure assumptions are met.

    Along with the new architecture is a new MIPS III/IV 
    recompiler frontend. This frontend has been rewritten from 
    the old x64-specific recompiler to generate UML opcodes
    instead. This means that the single recompiler can be used
    to target multiple backend architectures and should in
    theory produce identical results across all of them.

    The old 32-bit and 64-bit MIPS recompilers are now officially
    retired. The new system provides similar performance (within
    5% generally) to the old system and has similar compatibility.
    The only currently known issues are some problems with the
    two Gauntlet 3D games.

Added DS5002FP CPU core. [Manuel Abadia]

Added CDP1852 I/O buffer chip, and used it in Altair/Draco. 
[Curt Coder]

Found the proper algorithm to decrypt the blue TAB PCB in the funworld
driver. Replaced the old decryption tables with the proper decryption 
scheme. Updated technical notes. [Roberto Fresca]

Added uncompressed AVI recording: [Aaron Giles]

    Extended aviio to be able to write RGB bitmaps. Unfortunately, 
    the only option is fully uncompressed, which means the resulting 
    AVIs are *HUGE* and may not play correctly in realtime due to 
    high data rate. The intention is that these uncompressed AVIs 
    are post-processed by other utilities to compress the video and 
    produce a realtime playable result.

    Added new command-line option -aviwrite which works just like
    -mngwrite, except it produces AVIs and streams sound to them.
    Updated documentation accordingly.

    Shift+F12 still produces MNGs for now, though this might change
    in the future.

    Modified fileio.c to retain the full pathname to the file so
    that it can be queried while the file is open.

Updated TMS5200/5220 documentation and comments. Fixed the chirp table 
implementation in both the 51xx and 52xx chips. [Lord Nightmare]

Fixed default dipswitches on thoop to give more than 1 life.
[David Haywood]

Bug fixes for NamcoNA Hardware: [Phil Stroffolino]
 - support for scanline effect (fixes invisible dolphin in Emeralda 
    attract mode)
 - ROZ implementation no longer breaks Numan Athletics pixmap layer
 - blitter fixes; xday graphics are now correct
 - identified extra communications RAM used by xday (probably to 
    control printer)

Fixed crash in dynax games due to missing MSM6242 device. [Dirk Best]

Changed Black tiger main Z80 clock to 6MHz and sound Z80 clock to 
3.579545MHz as verified on PCB. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Consolidated opbase variables into a structure and rescoped them so
they are hidden for general access. [Atari Ace]
