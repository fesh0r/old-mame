0.86
----

While there are no new working games in this release it remains
interesting from a technical and development point of view mainly
due to the new PPC core as well as the Hyperstone and 37710 fixes.
It should also be a fairly stable release after the many input changes
which have taken place recently.

Driver Improvements:
--------------------

M37710, NamcoSS22 and C352 improvements [R.Belmont]
	M37710 changes (m37710.diff):
	- Data bus is actually 16 bit, not 8
	- Fixed saving of status register on interrupts
	- Fixed errors in PHB, PHT, PLT, and ANDB opcodes
	- Added XAB, PLB, and ROLB opcodes
	- Fixed IRQ dispatch errors
	- Various get_info fixes

	NamcoSS22 changes (s22.diff):
	- All CPU clocks changed to measured-by-Guru values
	- Handle the changed M37710 bus width
	- Temporarily disconnect shared RAM.  There's a
	problem where the 68020's shared RAM test wipes out
	the 37710's work variables and causes it to crash.  I
	suspect there's a register that halts or resets the
	37710.  (note: Prop Cycle has no POST and doesn't
	cause this problem, but all the other games do).

	C352 change (c352.diff):
	- Remove debug printf that accidentally snuck in

SPI Improvements [Ville Linde]
	- Improved (but not yet correct) tilemap decryption
	- Preliminary sprite priority support

PowerPC 403 core [Ville Linde, Bart Trzynadlowski, Stefano Teso]
	This is basically SuperModel (Sega Model 3 emu)'s PPC
	core minus the FPU and 6xx-series specific
	instructions (that stuff isn't ported to MAME yet). 
	As such, it's passed all manner of synthetic PPC
	torture tests and should be quite reliable for any
	PPC403-based hardware.
	
Virtua Racing improvements [Olivier Galibert, Andrew Gardner]

Hyperstone CPU Core Improvements [Tomasz Slanina, Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
	Tomasz Slanina 
	- interrputs after call and before frame are prohibited now
	- emulation of FCR register
	- Floating point opcodes (preliminary) 
	- Fixed stack addressing in RET/FRAME opcodes
	- Fixed bug in SET_RS macro
	- Fixed bug in return opcode (S flag)
	- Added C/N flags calculation in add/adc/addi/adds/addsi and some shift opcodes
	- Added writeback to ROL
	- Fixed ROL/SAR/SARD/SHR/SHRD/SHL/SHLD opcode decoding (Local/Global regs)
	- Fixed I and T flag in RET opcode
	- Fixed XX/XM opcodes
	- Fixed MOV opcode, when RD = PC
	- Fixed execute_trap() 
	- Fixed ST opcodes, when when RS = SR
	- Added interrupts
	- Fixed I/O addressing 

	Pierpaolo Prazzoli
	- Fixed fetch
	- Fixed decode of e132xs_xm opcode
	- Fixed 7 bits difference number in FRAME / RET instructions
	- Some debbugger fixes
	- Added generic registers decode function
	- Some other little fixes.

Jaleco Mahjong Driver update [Angelo Salese]
	some games are *almost* playable but still have protection issues
	
Adjusted Top Speed volume balance

	input_port_allocate()

Driver Improvements:
--------------------

- Fixed input port definition errors in megasys1. [Mamesick]

- Fixed input port definition errors in tnzs. [Inigo Luja]

- Fixed input port definition errors in taitosj, galaxian.
  [Aaron Giles]

- Changed 720' controls to use an analog joystick instead of a
  dial so that the original controller motion can be replicated.

  [Inigo Luja]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

  [Aaron Giles]

  default values were confusing people. [Aaron Giles]

- Added the ability for analog axes to return "invalid" as a value
  from the OSD layer, allowing them to dynamically disable themselves.
  Using this feature, the Windows version now autodetects analog
  versus digital axes and dynamically disables the analog values if
  it thinks you are using a digital axis. Note that this even works
  if you have a "switchable" gamepad. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed debugger crash when using F10 with the i960 core. [R. Belmont]
