General Source Changes
----------------------

Various ZN related updates [smf, R.Belmont]
	several games now display more, for example primrag2 plays the intro movie

i386 CPU core (used by the SPI driver) [Ville Linde]

ST-V Improvements [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
	gfx in colmns97 / sassisu / ejihon are improved

CHDMan CHDCD creation fix [R.Belmont]

Improved timing of several 68k instructions [Sebastien VOLPE]
	these changes could do with being verified on a real 68k

	m68kcpu.h, m68kcpu.c:
	---------------------
	A) scc (68000 only): CYC_SCC_R_FALSE was defined, not used, and misnamed as
	   the extra 2 cycles happens when CC is true: now used and renamed to
	   CYC_SCC_R_TRUE

	m68kmake.c:
	-----------
	B) add/adda/and/or/sub/suba (68000 only): the 'extra 2 cycles' cases were not
	   handled correctly: corrected to be effective on .l only, and also on register
	   direct (previously, all sizes were affected, and only in immediate mode)

	C) jmp d(An,Xn) / pea (An) (68000/68010): tables corrected

	D) movem (68000/68010): generated basecount were incorrect in many cases, so I
	   added a dedicated table

	m68k_in.c:
	----------

	E) movem.l d(PC),reglist / movem.l d(PC,Xn),reglist (68000/68010): changed
	   basecount

	F) asr/asl/lsr/lsl/ror/rol/roxr/roxl (68000/68010): added '+2n' cycles where
	   missing, as the shift/rotate memory is the only case where '+2n' does not
	   apply, and is treated in a specific opcode handler.

Fixed small v60 bug related to Aaron's recent changes [Olivier Galibert]

Fixed several small Hyperstone CPU core bugs [Pierpaolo Prazzoli, Mooglyguy]

Fixed a couple of compile warnings for other compilers [Lawrence Gold]

0.80u3

General Source Changes
----------------------

CHDCD / Konami GV update [R.Belmont]
- Preliminary CD-ROM support for CHDMAN.  Input is from CDRDAO
  .toc/.bin  images (cdrdao.sourceforge.net). CDRDAO comes with utilities
  to convert CDRWIN .cue/.bin images to .toc/.bin format.
- Intel Flash ROM emulation support
- CDROM emulation primitives, including Red Book audio playback
- CDROM support for the AM53cf96 SCSI controller
- Konami GV System driver.  GV System is identical to a home
  Playstation/PSOne console, except the CD-ROM is SCSI instead of 
  proprietary.

Stuff still in progress:
- The SPU emulation needs a lot of help, especially on Wedding Rhapsody. 
  smf is working on it.
- The SCSI CD-ROM emulation needs to be separated out from the AM53cf96 if
  we ever emulate other SCSI controllers or CD-ROM drives.
- CHDMAN doesn't output anything useful when you extract a CHD-CD.  It
  should write out a CDRDAO image.
- Audio tracks on CDs are not compressed at present (or more accurately
  they're gzip compressed, which is useless).  The plan is to use FLAC at
  some point.

Misc Fixes [Nathan Woods]
	src/mame.c:
	src/mame.h:
	src/windows/config.c:
	   - Changed options.savegame to be a string.  If this is a one 
	character string, then the save state is loaded as before.  If it is a 
	larger string, then cpu_loadsave_schedule_file() is used.

	src/state.c:
	src/state.h:
	   - Added a state_save_check_file(); a call that front ends can use to 
	validate a state save file

New Games supported or promoted from GAME_NOT_WORKING status:

Baby Phoenix/GV System [R.Belmont]

  no more strange resets)
Game is NOT playable (controls doesn't work).
Maybe something is not mapped correctly or
it's problem with protection (for example ,

Dipswitch fixes in Varia Metal [David Haywood]

Improvements to fitfight driver [Luis Faria]

Fixed the opcode view which in some cases displayed too many bytes on 32 bit
CPUs such as 68020 and Hyperstone [Bryan McPhail]

ST-V fixes [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
	- improved scaling tilemap backgrounds. Vfkids, colmns97 and vfremix backgrounds
	  are better now.
	- fixed a problem where entering and existing service mode during game causes master
	 / slave communication to fail. It turned out that slave cpu should be reset when it
	 is turned off and on. This helps all games in driver.

Air Rescue
	uses an unemulated math DSP and may also require emulation of two system32 boards
	at once, not an easy task.
Buriki One (Hyper NeoGeo 64)
	very preliminary driver, loads and decodes the gfx, attempts to run some of the
	code.  No Video or Sound emulation is done.  For now the GFX can be viewed with F4
