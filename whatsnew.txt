Source Changes
--------------
-Make modernized i86 core endian-safe again [Alex Jackson]

-Created new device_video_interface. Right now its sole purpose is to [Aaron Giles]
 house a screen tag and to find the screen at startup, providing an
 m_screen object that can be used. One nice feature is that if there is
 only one screen and no screen has been specified, it will auto
 configure to that screen. This removes the need to explicitly specify
 a screen in the configuration for a large chunk of drivers (though
 doing so never hurts). A new macro MCFG_VIDEO_SET_SCREEN is provided,
 though devices are encouraged to define their own that maps there so
 it is obvious which device is being targeted. The
 device_video_interface's validation function will error if an invalid
 screen is specified or if no screen is provided but there are multiple
 screens present.

 Updated all devices that currently had an m_screen in them to use the
 device_video_interface instead. This also has the nice benefit of
 flagging video-related devices for categorization purposes. It also
 means all these devices inherit the same screen-finding behaviors. For
 devices that had interfaces that specified a screen tag, those have
 been removed and all existing structs updated.
 
 Added an optional_device<screen_device> m_screen to the base
 driver_device. If you name your screen "screen" (as most drivers do),
 you will have free access to your screen this way.

 Future updates include:
  * Updating all devices referencing machine.primary_screen to use the
    device_video_interface instead
  * Updating all drivers referencing machine.primary_screen to use the
    m_screen instead
  * Removing machine.primary_screen entirely
 
-i286: modernize [Carl] 

-Modernized galeco, okim6376, vr0video, mb87078, snk6502 devices.  [Osso]

-Adds a watchpoint debug view. [Andrew Gardner]

-Adds the watchpoint view to the QT Debugger's "Break|Watchpoints"
 window. [Andrew Gardner]

-Fix long-standing architectural wart: the priority bitmap is no longer [Aaron Giles]
 owned by the tilemap system, and no longer exists globally in the
 machine. Instead it is allocated per-screen for all systems. This has
 several side-effects:

 1. Previously, the pdrawgfx* functions were already changed to take
 the priority bitmap as a parameter. Now all other hand-crafted
 functions that mess with the priority bitmap generally must do so as
 well, and have been updated.

 2. Calls to the tilemap system now need to provide a screen_device.
 This is not just for the priority_bitmap, but also for screen
 flipping, which previously always assumed the "primary screen" when
 doing flipping calculations.

 3. All devices that implemented tilemap-like functionality have been
 updated to follow the same pattern, since they largely tend to call
 through to the core tilemap system at some point.

-ym2413.c - Reverted KSL value order to 0, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0dB/oct after
 testing with a real YM2413 [Wouter Vermaelen]

-Modernized galaxian sound device.  [Osso]

-Split eeprom.c into a base class base_eepr-om_device and a [Aaron Giles]
 serial-specific subclass serial_eeprom_device. Moved the latter into
 its own file eepromser.c and significantly cleaned up/simplified the
 code. The new code should be functionally the same as the previous
 code, but expect that to change soon. As a side-effect, the size and
 bus width of the EEPROM is now specified in the ADD macro rather than
 in the interface structure.

-Rewrite serial EEPROM devices, breaking them out into separate chips [Aaron Giles]
 of the proper size and protocol. Update all drivers, removing custom
 implementations, and replacing them with standard ones. Moved core
 read, write, erase functionality into the EEPROM base class a
 simulated delays in write/erase cycles. Still some more
 testing/verification work left to do.

-Add support for CD2501ECD variant of tms52xx, used in the TI 99/8
 prototype. Renamed TMC0285 to the more correct CD2501E in the TI
 99/4a. [mizapf, Lord Nightmare]

 into a full-assed device, leveraging the memory_array class.

-neogeo.c: fix memory leak, clean up inputs a bit [Alex Jackson]

-Added eeprompar.*, implementing a simple interface for parallel [Aaron Giles]
 EEPROMs.

-Created atari_eeprom_device which wraps a 2804 or 2816 EEPROM with the [Aaron Giles]
 standard Atari write-locking mechanism. Updated all drivers to use
 this, and removed all EEPROM stuff from atarigen.

-wd_fdc: Don't switch off the motor when the fdc doesn't have a motor
 control pin [O. Galibert, Duke]

 [Phil Bennett]

-Renamed TLCS900H to TMP95C061, moved the I/O handling into it's own
 class & hooked up TO1/TO3 to output on Port A. A hack is needed
 because ngpc doesn't set PACR/PAFC, which may be because it's a custom
 part. Changed Taito PJC to use TMP95C063. Separated I/O Ports on both
 CPU's so you can apply the devcb2 callbacks individually. [smf]

 it & you must load from a file as if you load from eeprom then it only
 finds zeros. [smf]

-Renamed IDE8 to XTIDE. [smf]

-polepos.c: Added Dipswitch locations to the Pole Position and Pole Position 2 sets.
 [Brian Troha]

-added undocumented opcode that behaves like DPCL [smf]

-IDE: Uses one timer instead of anonymous timers, so that resetting the
 device will stop any outstanding work. BSY is always set when waiting
 for the busy timer to fire. Implemented DASP & PDIAG functionality,
 device 1 is detected during reset & if device 1 fails diagnostic then
 device 0 sets bit 7 of it's diagnostic result. Ide cards now default
 to 1 hard disk, otherwise device 1 without a chd will cause device 0
 to report a controller error (AMIBIOS for example doesn't allow
 booting from device 0 if device 1 fails). Timing of DASP & PDIAG is
 set very short because of lack of wait states when accessing ATA bus.
 Improved SRST functionality, which has meant viper needed to be
 changed to trigger a hard reset instead of a soft reset. Writes to the
 command register are now ignored with BSY or DRQ is set (packet
 devices can accept the DEVICE RESET command but they are not supported
 yet). [smf]

-Memory system: added endianness to the memory_share class.  [Aaron Giles]

-Tilemap system: numerous changes:  [Aaron Giles]
 * Moved remaining legacy macros and typedefs to tilelgcy.h. This
    revealed a few drivers mixing and matching modern & legcy, which
    have now been fixed.
 * Changed get info callback signature to no longer pass the user_data
    pointer, but instead pass a reference to the tilemap object
    itself. Updated those few drivers using user_data to pull it out
    of the tilemap object with the new user_data() getter method.
 * Changed get info and mapping callbacks to be device_delegates so
    that they can be described at config time.
 * Added tilemap_memory object that is used internally for reading/
    writing to memory that backs a tilemap. This object is used to
    track a memory pointer that backs tilemap memory, and also is
    designed to transparently handle all bus width and endianness
    associated with reading and writing data in a tilemap.
 * Incorporated two tilemap_memory objects (basemem and extmem) into
    the tilemap object and added accessors to them, as well as
    read/write handlers for reading/writing to entries stored in the
    memory. This means that tilemap get info callbacks can now easily
    read data out of the tilemap in a generic way.
 * Rejiggered the initialization sequence for tilemap objects so that
    the tilemap_manager is not required to be present at
    instantiation.
 * Created a new tilemap_device, which can be used to declare a
    tilemap in the machine config, and which also is a tilemap object
    itself. The tilemap device will look for shared memory regions
    called "<tag>" and "<tag>_ext" and automatically plug them into
    the tilemap. The device also provides write handlers that can be
    used to write to the tilemap memory and mark tiles dirty, saving
    the need for each driver to write their own.

-Device system: moved required/optional device finders to a new header
 devfind.h.  [Aaron Giles]

-Atari drivers: removed all playfield and alpha memory and tilemap
 variables, apart from those needed by atarivc-using games (this will
 become a device in a future update). Updated all Atari 16-bit drivers
 to use the new tilemap_device instead, which provides all the needed
 functionality in a more generic way.  [Aaron Giles]

-volfied.c: Added dipswitch locations to the Volfied sets. [Brian Troha]

-thepit.c: Added dipswitch locations to The Pit, Round-Up / Fitter,
 Intrepid and Dock Man / Port Man sets. Gave Desert Dan it's own
 dipswitches and corrected them based on results of game play. [Brian Troha]

-suna8.c: Added dipswitch locations to Rough Ranger / Super Ranger,
 Hard Head, Spark Man, Star Fighter, Hard Head 2 and Brick Zone sets.

-Data East Protection Work [Charles MacDonald, David Haywood]
 * Complete new Data East 146 emulation based on extensive hardware
   tests.  The following now use a single implementation rather than
   incomplete per-game implementations
   Edward Randy (60)
   Mutant Fighter (66)
   Captain America (75)
   Lemmings (75)
   Robocop 2 (75)
   Super Shanghai Dragon's Eye (146)
   Funky Jet (146)
   Sotsugyo Shousho (146)
   Nitro Ball (146)
   Fighter's History (146)

   addition to bringing Super Shanghai to a working state.
 * Similar work has been started for the 104 based games, but no
   complete table has been derived from real hardware yet.
