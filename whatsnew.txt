Source Changes
--------------
-Added support for DEVCB_UNMAPPED, that will do the logging on
 read/write of device callback, preventing a need for making dummy log
 line handlers [Miodrag Milanovic]

-if the start of a multi-line comment is indented then following
 comment lines will be indented with tabs up to that point. [smf]

-Information adjustments for naomi.c, chihiro.c, mame.lst reflecting
 latest discoveries. [f205v]

-New preliminary driver for Webak MPU-12 platform. [Roberto Fresca]

-Refactored the code in jedutil to support the  viewing of a GAL16V8
 device and added a new command line option of "-viewlist" which will
 print out a list of all the devices that can be viewed in human
 readable logic equations. Also updated the jedutil regression test to
 support passing in an additional argument of "debug" to print out a
 detailed log.  Also moved the jedutil regression test data into
 separate directories composed of the device's name to make things more
 organized. [Kevin Eshbach]

-Removed protection hack patches and emulated protection routines for
 Caveman Ninja [IQ_132 & JackC]

-Added experimental support for using Berkeley PLA files as input to
 jedutil. [Curt Coder]

-memory: Fix dynamic recursive device mapping [O. Galibert]
 Situation:
	 * you have a device (pc-fdc) with a memory map on it
	 * you map it dynamically into a cpu (maincpu) address space with
		install_device (isa-fdc does that)
	 * the device pc-fdc has a subdevice (upd765)
	 * the subdevice upd765 has its own memory map
	 * the pc-fdc memory map includes the upd765 memory map through
		AM_DEVICE("upd765", ...)
	Before the fix, the code would search for upd765 as a subdevice of
	maincpu and not of pc-fdc.

-am9517a: Don't grossly fail on verify [O. Galibert]

-3X3 Puzzle update [David Haywood]
  * fixed visible area
  * added the 2nd button
  * added the Demo Sound dip

-Fixed sound banking in 3X3 Puzzle [Mariusz Wojcieszek]

-Added scrolling to 3X3 Puzzle [Mariusz Wojcieszek]

-SCSI: Uses logical levels rather than voltage levels for control signals,
 you have to write 0 to the data lines when you're not sending data.
 Added a kludge to stop the ff from the 6522 from preventing the bus
 from being read, this may or may not be how the hardware really works.
 [smf]

-i386dasm.c: [Peter Ferrie]
  * added numerous opcodes for newer CPUs;
  * added some undocumented-but-supported opcodes from old CPUs;
  * corrected naming of two opcodes

-port 0x64 opcode 0xd1 should incur no delay when delivering. This
 allows, for example, su2000 to start booting to the CMOS setup screen
 [Peter Ferrie]

-Improved inputs in 3X3 Puzzle [Stephh]

-Aristocrat MK6 base system bios for New South Wales region
 [Heihachi_73]

-hercules : hooked up mechanical sounds [Robbbert].

-memory: Map from the cpu's owner, not the root device, otherwise
 siblings of cpus coming from config fragments aren't happy.
 [O. Galibert]

-clifront.c: Added verifysoftlist command for verifying software
 availability for separate software lists.  [Wilbert Pol]

-Created a base class delegate_common_base for all delegate 
 types. Created a binding_type_exception which is thrown when
 a bind attempt fails due to mismatched types.[Aaron Giles]
 
 Added helper templates to driver_device to wrap legacy
 device read/write handlers into driver_device member functions.
 This should help move some things forward until more common
 code is converted into proper devices.
 
 Introduce new module devcb2 which contains modernized
 versions of devcb. Compared to previous implementation
 this one is simpler overall, trampolining calls through
 a single internal set of adapter functions. The new
 versions are also designed to be specified in the
 machine_config rather than in structures, so they are
 no longer simple POD types. Additional new/changed
 features:
 
  * reads and writes can map to delegates for line or 8/16/32/64-bit
  * reads and writes can map to an I/O port
  * reads can be mapped to a constant value, with or without logging
  * writes can be mapped to a device's input line
  * all reads/writes can have a shift, mask, and/or xor applied
  * devices can opt to make the functions safe-if-NULL when resolving
  * only member function types are supported
 
 Rewrote the YM2151 interface to be fully modernized, and
 removed the ym2151_interface struct in favor of inline configs
 using the new devcb2 mechanism. In many cases, removed
 no longer needed trampolines, instead taking advantage of
 direct support for input line writes.
 
-switched SCSICB to use DEVCB2 [smf]

-Optimized the PLA implementation and added simple caching with
 significant performance increase. [Curt Coder]

-tlcs900.c: Implemented the 4-byte prefetch queue.  [Wilbert Pol]

 [Mooglyguy]

-Fixed functional issues in Atmel AVR opcodes: COM, NEG, LSR [Mooglyguy]

-Hooked up polepos.c, portrait.c and tomcat.c to use the new tms5220
 implementation.  [Osso]

 end of the world [O. Galibert]

-addrmap: Avoid a collision between address_map the type and the method
 of the device_memory_interface class [O. Galibert]

-pgm.c: Fix level 6 crash on kov . [IQ_132]

-megadrvb.c: simplify decode function for srmdb. [IQ_132]

-Cleaned up mustache boy vblank interrupts: Got rid of the nasty
 long-int hack in mustache boy in favor of the same 'vblank in+vblank
 out' int scheme the other similar seibu games of this era used
 (panicrd, darkmist). This seems much more likely to be what the actual
 pcb used, and works just fine. [Lord Nightmare]

-changed 2 disc hack to use 1 drive [smf]

-SCSICD now has a CDDA sub device [smf]

-avr8: Implemented MULS, ANDI, STD Z+, LD -Z, LD Y+, LD -Y, LD -X,
 SWAP, ASR, ROR, and SBIS opcodes. [MooglyGuy]

-avr8: Moved Timer 0-2 into the CPU core itself, 30x driver speedup
 [MooglyGuy]

-Emulate protection in sf2rb, sf2rb2's (cps1.c) and ichirjbl (segac2.c)
 rather than simply patch it out.  [IQ_132]

 during a time slice were causing all subsequent 1-cycle opcodes to
 deduct 2 or 3 cycles for the remainder of the time slice instead.
 [MooglyGuy]

-cleaned up the ide controller enough to change the irq to a DEVCB2
 [smf]

-avr8.c: Fixed register indexing for MULSU opcode. [MooglyGuy]

-avr8.c: Fixed register writeback for LD -Z and LD -Y opcodes.

    running.
 * Fixed Power Card graphics ROM load..
 * Added technical notes.

-romload: Tell in which zips a missing rom was searched for
 [O. Galibert]

-Moved jolycdat program to Bonus Card, making it parent. This program
 is a real original Bonus Card program, and the PCB was populated with
 common Jolly Card graphics wrongly. The other Bonus Card set was
 turned as clone, since has a fake copyright string (hack). Also added
 some technical notes. [Roberto Fresca]

-More Fun World driver improvements... [Roberto Fresca]
 * Renamed the internal layout artwork: bigdeal --> bonuscrd.

Source Changes
--------------
-Memory handler normalization, part 1. READ/WRITE_DEVICE*_HANDLERs are
 now passed an address_space &, and the 8-bit variants get a mem_mask
 as well. This means they are now directly compatible with the member
 function delegates. Added a generic address space to the driver_device
 that can be used when no specific address space is available. Also
 added DECLARE_READ/WRITE_DEVICE*_HANDLER macros to declare device
 callbacks with default mem_mask parameters. [Aaron Giles]

-Memory handler normalization, part 2. Change legacy read/write
 handlers to take an address_space & instead of an address_space *.
 Also update pretty much all other functions to take a reference where
 appropriate. [Aaron Giles]

-Memory handler cleanup 3. Add mem_mask parameter to 8-bit handlers to
 match the others. To ease pain, added DECLARE_READ/WRITE_HANDLER
 macros that set up a default parameter. Also updated devcb so that the
 handlers can be called with or without the mem_mask. [Aaron Giles]

-Seibu COP: Added 0x1c param to 0x0205 command, fixes at least sprite
 positioning during intros of Raiden 2 and Zero Team (but breaks
 gameplay in Zero Team, needs investigation) [Angelo Salese, Smitdogg]

-Seibu COP: Made 0x42c2 command more accurate, makes Legionnaire
 enemies to behave properly and match finally starts in Seibu Cup
