General Improvements
--------------------


Misc. Sega Improvements
	Improved inputs in DDCrew, all 4 players can now be used, although only
	the service coin works. [David Haywood]

	Hooked up Nitro button in Turbo Outrun [smf]

	Improved GPRider Sound [R.Belmont]

	Fixed Cotton, Turbo Outrun filenames [deadscreem]

	Fixed Thunderblade filenames
	
Namco System 1 update [Nicola Salmoria]

	- added a new function tilemap_draw_primask(). This takes an additional 
	parameter, which is ANDed with the contents of priority_bitmap before ORing 
	it with the specified priority. Essentially, the old tilemap_draw() is 
	equivalent to tilemap_draw_pribuffer(..., 0xff). The two should probably be 
	unified. This new handling of priority_bitmap allows a more intuitive 
	handling of pdrawgfx(), and more layers to be used (up to 31, instead of 
	just 5 - Namco S1 needed 8).
	NOTE: to implement this change, I had to disable the asm optimized routines 
	PDT16 and PDO16 in windows/oslinline.h. If they are useful for performance, 
	they should be updated and reenabled.
	
	- fixed sprite handling and removed all the nonsense hacks from the video 
	update
	- made sprite/tilemap priorities orthogonal (not sure if it was needed).
	- also updated System 86 (which uses the same sprite hardware) to the latest 
	code. Curiously, this introduces sprite/sprite priority issues in Wonder 
	Momo. I'm puzzled by this.
	- vastly improved the key custom emulation, shrinking it down to three basic 
	types. This also fixed issues with pistoldm (e.g. bomb explosions, and other 
	random events).
	- pistoldm061yel
	- fixed DAC sounds in berabohm and faceoff, two sounds at the same time were 
	causing severe slowdowns.
	- fixed Namco logo in Dangerous Seed
	- cleaned up input ports, using PORT_INCLUDE
	- found some more debug dip switches
	- dspirit061gre
	- added support for visibility window, this fixes countless issues with 
	partial video updates and the intro of Rompers
	- namcosx36rc2gre
	- fixed berabohm inputs
	- better ROM loading, closer to the hardware (though it uses more memory)
	- toggling the test mode dip switch is enough to enter test mode - no need 
	to reset
	- removed the galaga88 set: it was a hacked version removing the key custom 
	checks and disabling ROM checksum tests
	- cleaned up the CUS30 wavedata/sound command/RAM interface, put it all in a 
	single function
	- splatter061gre: I don't think this is a bug
	- splatter061gre2: I don't think this is a bug, just dark brown would look 
	black on an arcade monitor
	- splatter061gre3: please verify if this still applies / I don't think it is 
	a bug
	- splatter061gre4: please verify if this still applies
	- namcos1c070u5gre: I don't think this is a bug, attract mode plays back a 
	few seconds from the last game played. In bootup, there is no previous game, 
	so no demo play. I agree it's awkward, though.


Discrete Sound Update [Derrick Renaud]
	Discrete Sound Changes
	======================
	* Modified Discrete core node inputs to use pointers to the data, instead of
	moving the data into the inputs at each step.  This speeds up discrete emulation.
	* modified all current modules and drivers to use new code.


	New Discrete Modules Added
	==========================
	* DISCRETE_555_ASTABL has been modified to remove control voltage support.
	  DISCRETE_555_ASTABL_CV has been added if control voltage is used.


	Game Driver Changes
	===================
	* frogs-  Removed discrete tongue sound for now.  Added sample support.
	The buzz sound of flys is constant because it can't be emulated properly until
	full discrete support is added.  Samples are from the ones posted by Twisty.

General Improvements
--------------------

Many improvements to Sega System Pre16,16a,16b,18 drivers [Aaron Giles]
	Drivers cleaned up
	
	Most known video issues are now fixed
	Alien Storm, DDCrew, Clutch Hitter, Laser Ghost, Cotton and
	many others have greatly improved video.
	
	Alien Storm is fully playable
	
	DD Crew is fully playable but requires inputs to be fixed
	 (currently only service coin and controls for 1 player work)
	
	Laser Ghost would probably be playable if the controls were
	correctly hooked up

	Moonwalker requires improvements to the MCU emulation
	
	We will now accept bug reports at Mametesters.org for any games
	running on the following drivers
		segas16a.c, segas16b.c, segas18.c
	Most of the bootlegs are still running on system16.c, please do
	not report bugs for these, nor for outrun or afterburner hardware.

Added other hyperstone models, converted vamphalf driver to use 16-bit version [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]


Discrete Sound Update [Derrick Renaud]

	Discrete Sound Changes
	======================
	* Removed the memory mapping system from the discrete inputs.  It served no
	purpose and was never functional.  It only added a layer of confusion to the
	code by forcing it's use on all current drivers that do not need it.  If
	memory mapped inputs are needed in the future (not likely), then they can be
	added with a DISCRETE_INPUT_MAP function.
	* Now the discrete inputs are written to by their node name only.
	  eg: discrete_sound_w(NODE_xx, data)
	* DISCRETE_INPUT and DISCRETE_INPUTX have been removed in favour of new
	easier to use input modules.
	* modified all current drivers to use new code.
	* moved discrete sound code from drivers and put in sndhrdw\
	
	New Discrete Modules Added
	==========================
	* DISCRETE_INPUT_DATA(node)  - accepts 8-bit data from discrete_sound_w.
	Output at reset is 0.
	* DISCRETE_INPUT_LOGIC(node) - 0 if data=0; 1 if data=!0.  Output at reset
	is 0.
	* DISCRETE_INPUT_NOT(node)   - 0 if data=!0; 1 if data=0.  Output at reset
	is 1.
	
	* DISCRETE_INPUTX_DATA(node, gain, offset, init)
	* DISCRETE_INPUTX_LOGIC(node, gain, offset, init)
	* DISCRETE_INPUTX_NOT(node, gain, offset, init)
	                             - same as above, but will modify the output by the
	                               given GAIN and OFFSET.  At reset the output will
	                               be INIT modified by GAIN and OFFSET.
	
	Game Driver Changes
	===================
	* skydiver -  added proper watchdog.  Merged memory map and added proper
	mirroring.  Fixed coin input bug skydiver078u3yel.  It's not a 100% accurate
	fix, but will work until I get the exact interrupt time.  The current
	interrupt time was 100% off.  It is now less then 25% off.  :-)
	
	
	
	
	
Windows Debugger Updates
------------------------

Fixed some compile errors [Nathan Woods]

Misc updates [Aaron Giles]
* Added a "PC" register to the I386 core so that it should work in the new debugger
* Cleaned up stepping code
* Now refresh the display and all debugger windows after each step while stepping
* When running with the debugger window open (F5 or 'go'), now update the debugger views
4 times per second
* Can now break into the debugger even if you are focused on a debugger window
* Memory/disasm windows now come up with the currently active CPU selected by default
* added a new command: focus <cpunum>, which is equivalent to ignoring all 
other CPUs
* changed ignore and observe to support multiple parameters so you can say "ignore 2,3,4"
* changed ignore so that you are not allowed to ignore the last CPU
* fixed ignore behavior so that other CPUs are truly ignored
* fixed register window so that change hilights are maintained during scrolling and updates
* changed debug memory accessors so they don't log on invalid memory accesses
* tweaked the help text to indicate that help <command> works
* added a new text attribute DCA_CURRENT, which is separate from DCA_SELECTED -- the main
visible difference is that the memory view editing cursor is now hilighted red instead of
yellow

In-line memory editing is now supported. To do this, I added a generic 
cursor concept to the view system. Each view can handle it however they 
want. Right now only the memory view supports a cursor. [Aaron Giles]

Click in the memory view to place the cursor. Type over nibbles with 0-F, or 
use the arrow keys to navigate around. Tab cycles between the edit box and 
the memory editor. [Aaron Giles]

updated psx core to show more registers [smf]

New Windows based debugger [Aaron Giles]  
----------------------------------------

Note: The new debugger is enabled as the default debugger for the next few u
releases (in a debug build only) to allow feedback, it can be disabled by
changing the makefile

(description of 1st update)

There are some new behaviors and new ways of doing things you should be 
aware of. By default the debugger no longer "auto hides". This was a remnant 
of the way the old debugger worked that I have gotten rid of. If you want to 
hide all the debugger windows, just close the "main" debug window. It will 
return if you break in the debugger at a future time.

The "main" window has four panes: a register list on the left, a disassembly 
around the current PC at the top, a console output window in the middle, and 
an input line at the bottom. The input line supports full editing features, 
and you can also use up arrow/down arrow to cycle through recently typed 
commands.

Hitting Enter on a blank line in the console is equivalent to single 
stepping once. You can also do that with F11. To run, either use the "go" 
command or hit F12 (or close the "main" window). To run until the next CPU, 
either use the "next" command or hit F6.

You can bring up multiple independent memory and/or disassembly windows by 
using the Debug menu. Each window can look at a different address space on 
any CPU. You can enter any expression (including those using registers from 
the CPU) into the entry line at the top of these windows in order to specify 
which address to begin displaying at.

I've implemented a number of useful commands in the console. Type "help" to 
navigate the extensive online documentation for a number of examples on how 
to use these features. You can do some really cool stuff now with the 
conditional watchpoints and breakpoints.

This is a work-in-progress, but it's pretty good now (IMHO) and stable for 
common debugging operations. Let me know what you like/dislike about it and 
what sorts of features you feel are still lacking.

(description of 2nd update)

F12 now means "run and hide the debugger". I found this was too useful to 
get rid of entirely.
F5 just means "run", keeping the debugger visible.

Enabling the debugger now forces window mode and prevents you from switching 
to full screen mode.

(description of 3rd update)

* Added step over/step out functionality. F10 or "over" steps over an 
instruction. Shift+F11 or "out" steps out of a subroutine or exception 
handler. Note that this feature relies on the disassembler to produce some 
flags indicating which instructions which need to be stepped over (generally 
CALLs and TRAPs) and which instructions end a step out search (generally 
RETURNs).
* Modified the 680x0 and MIPS3 disassemblers to support these features.
* Changed the disassembly view to back up 3 instructions when resetting 
(that is, the current PC should appear on the 4th line instead of the 1st 
line). This is not perfect, but works pretty well overall and should help 
see the previous couple of instructions when, say, a watchpoint is hit.
* Improved filtering of keypresses so that they don't leak into the game 
when you are typing in the debugger.
