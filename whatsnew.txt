[Tafoid]

SNES video updates: [Fabio Priuli]
 * re-enabled video debug functionalities in debug build (to toggle 
    background layers)
 * added proper priority tables for various bg/obj layers
 * largely simplified tile and line drawing routines, and fixed small 
    bits here and there
 * further simplification of tile drawing routines
 * added palette index to 8bpp tiles (correct color_shift still unsure, 
    though)
 * reworked video drawing routine to simplify the various graphic 
    mode drawing and to allow proper implementation of priority orders 
    (especially bg3 priority bit and mode 7 priority order)

 * improved Mode 7 math precision (but still some issues remain) and

    formula)
 * moved some more register contents to PPU struct

    audio/galaxian.h
 - Split some memory maps into sound related and not sound related 
    parts.

    cresta) at compile time. This leads to slightly different volume 
    levels. Hit sound (explosion) has been hacked to increase volume. 
    Currently, we can not accurately model the switch/opamp filter 
    circuit.
 - Rewrote timer code so that the pitch timer is only used when it 
    produces audible results.

Cojag/jaguar video updates (primarily for MESS) [Robbbert]

Improved speaker-toggle emulation with alias filter. 
[Anders Hallstrom]

NES: Fixed bank switching in multigm3 (broken due to a mistake of

Updated romload.c and validity.c to not rely on global variables.
[Atari Ace]

Corrected resistor values in Cliff Hanger discrete sound based on 
actual PCB values. [Ruben Panossian]

Removed DAA tables from the 8085 and Z180 implementations in favor of
just computing the values. Also fixed code in 8085 to prevent
accidental multiple reads due to macro overuse. [hap]

Added game time and coinage DIP switches to Space Walk, along with

[Corrado Tomaselli]
 - system18 motherboards
 - ninja ryukenden
 - tricky doc
 - raiden

in Fantasy Zone, introduced when that cycle eating thing was added. 
[hap]

Calc 3 update: [David Haywood]
 - Shuffled a few things around based on new findings
 - Added an extra decryption table used for the Brap Boys startup code
    (still doesn't do anything interesting)
 - Noted that one of the unknown parameters for the MCU Init command 
    is where it reads / writes eeprom data from.
 - Noted that an additional parameter in the MCU commands may cause 
   further displacement of the writeback address, as BRap Boys seems 
   to rely on this (needs further testing) - added a hack for now so 
   that BRap Boys places the writeback address of the initial table 
   somewhere that causes it to get executed.

Marked graphics ROMs on Led Storm Rally 2011 (US) as bad, as they
cannot possibly be the right ones for this set. [David Haywood]

Properly added support for namcos2 multiple posirq anyway. Fixes
the following issues:[hap]

[Corrado Tomaselli]

 * Updated all of the TRON sets with location of the roms and the 
    board they belong to
 * Updated the name of the PROM on the Super Sound I/O board
 * Added notes about PALs that need to be dumped (The same PAL part 
    numbers are also  used on Xenophobe and probably other MCR II & 
    III games.)

Fixed chdman -update to leave the write protect state alone when 
updating uncompressed CHDs. [Michael Zapf]

Changed default key for Mahjong P1 Bet to '3', because '2' was
