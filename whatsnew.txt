Note that the next version of MAME will be 0.100. If you have code that
depends on there being only two digits after the decimal, you had better fix
it before then!

Source Changes
--------------
Added new 'screen' parameter to the VIDEO_UPDATE callbacks. It is not
currently used but is a placeholder for the future. [Aaron Giles]

Replaced direct access to Machine->scrbitmap in the following drivers with
the use of force_partial_update(): m92.c, m107.c, astrocde.c, battlera.c,
snes.c. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote the Z80/Z180 daisy chaining logic to work a little closer to the
hardware. Updated the Z80 CTC and PIO modules to support the new model.
Changed the CTC module to not generate interrupts if there is an outstanding
request on the same timer is currently in service; this allows Journey to 
(finally) run with the correct CPU speed. [Aaron Giles]

Partial rewrite of the MCR video system. Should still work roughly the same,
just a little different under the covers. This is still very much a work in
progress. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed clipping in nemesis.c. [Fujix]

Normalized names in Konami drivers according R. Belmont's wishes. [Mamesick]

More PowerPC updates: [Nathan Woods]
 - Moved update_counters() to be executed after the DRC epilogue code 
    is appended; now behaves more like the non-DRC core
 - Fixed some bugs in DRC exeception handling (SRR1 was not being set 
    up properly, and not all MSR flags were being cleared)
 - Refactored DRC core to call MMU hooks
 - ISI exceptions will now be thrown if the MMU hooks report an 
    unexecutable address in the DRC core
 - Fixed a rounding error in the decrementer
 - Added support for decrementer exceptions when the DEC register is 
    written to in both cores
 - Added support for ISI/DSI exceptions with setjmp()/longjmp() in 
    the non-DRC core

Significant rewrite of the Legend of Kage driver: [Phil Stroffolino]
 - correct/added dipswitches
 - converted to use pdrawgfx; affects stage#4
 - a priority effect on the title screen has been mapped - this gives the 
    foreground layer priority over all sprites, and screenshots now match 
    those from arcade flyers.
 - the "virtual palette" hack has been removed; it was an optimization from 
    back when we used 8 bit color and hardware palettes.

Cleaned up the Soungoku Mahjong driver, fixed colors, improved sound and 
fixed the hang before the match started. Also I found the output for the 
coins used to play the match. It's still missing something to enable / 
disable the tilemaps. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed the i386->z80 communication in the Seibu SPI driver. This fixes the 
flash rom update and should also fix any remaining hangs/pauses. The flash 
rom update should take around 5 minutes. Now all games should have proper 
sample data. [Ville Linda, David Haywood]

Some progress on the Deco 156 encryption. [David Haywood]

Source Changes
--------------
Changed how perodic timers are defined. Previously, you would specify a
number which was interpreted either as Hz (if less than 50000) or as
nanoseconds (if greater than 50000). Now, the time is specified as a period
and you use the standard TIME_IN_HZ or TIME_IN_NS macros. [Aaron Giles]

Turned on address error checking in the 68000 core. This slows things down a
bit but is more accurate and allows correct behavior of a couple of badly-
programmed games. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed several issues with address error checking in the 68000 core.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed 68000 bug that treated 8-bit branches with $FF offsets as illegal,
rather than allowing them and generating an address error. [Aaron Giles]

Created a new header file mamecore.h, which contains the core common useful
macros and typedefs that were scattered throughout the header files. Also
added endian swapping macros from MESS. [Aaron Giles]

Fully deprecated the use of cpu_setbank(), which was long ago replaced with
memory_set_bankptr(). [Aaron Giles]

Did some major cleanup on the MCR drivers [Aaron Giles]
- Implemented Super Sound I/O interrupts properly.
- Filled out all memory maps according to schematics.
- Fixed sound sync with various sound boards, allowing for kludges to be
  removed from Power Drive and Star Guards.
- Re-verified all connections from wiring diagrams.
- Documented various lamp and driver boards from the games.

Some makefile tweaks to hopefully catch variable declaration problems that
kept creeping into builds. Switched gcc compiler standard to gnu89.
[Atari Ace]

Removed usage of dirent.h APIs on Windows builds. [Atari Ace]

Corrected resolution to 256x256 in Stagger I, Red Hawk, Sen Jin - Guardian 
Storm. All other games still have old visible area that is correct for them.
[Mamesick]

Fixed crash in Volfied and Operation Wolf due to improper timer usage.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed one of the TC360 sprite blending modes (used in Pulirula round 2 and 
Liquids Kids attract mode). [Bryan McPhail]

Fixed sprite/tilemap placement in Legend of Kage. [Phil Stroffolino]

PowerPC core update: [Nathan Woods]
- Added infrastructure to generate DSI and ISI exceptions
- Made the lbz/lbzu/lbzux/lbzx instructions properly clear out the 
  high 24 bits in the results
- Added SRR0 and SRR1 to the debug view

Did some cleanups in the vamphalf.c driver. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed speedbal again, after breaking it in the last update. 
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Changed Nitro Ball to use the new deco16_tilemap_34_combine_draw function 
Bryan added some time ago. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added a sprite wrap around needed in Riot level 2. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added sound to Dragon Bowl. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
