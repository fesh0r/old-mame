Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- A number of obsolete backward compatibility macros have been removed. [Aaron Giles]
  See this list for the equivalents if you have a driver that is using them:

     cpu_set_reset_line -> cpunum_set_input_line
     cpu_set_halt_line -> cpunum_set_input_line
     cpu_set_irq_line -> cpunum_set_input_line
     cpu_set_irq_line_and_vector -> cpunum_set_input_line_and_vector

     timer_suspendcpu -> cpunum_suspend/cpunum_resume
     timer_holdcpu -> cpunum_suspend/cpunum_resume
     cpu_getstatus -> cpunum_is_suspended
     timer_get_overclock -> cpunum_get_clockscale
     timer_set_overclock -> cpunum_set_clockscale

     cpu_gettotalcycles -> cpunum_gettotalcycles
     cpu_gettotalcycles64 -> cpunum_gettotalcycles64

     keyboard_name -> code_name
     keyboard_pressed -> code_pressed
     keyboard_pressed_memory -> code_pressed_memory
     keyboard_pressed_memory_repeat -> code_pressed_memory_repeat
     keyboard_read_async -> code_read_async

     install_mem_read*_handler -> memory_install_read*_handler
     install_mem_write*_handler -> memory_install_write*_handler
     install_port_read*_handler -> memory_install_read*_handler
     install_port_write*_handler -> memory_install_write*_handler
     memory_install_read*_handler_mirror -> memory_install_read*_handler
     memory_install_write*_handler_mirror -> memory_install_write*_handler

     READ_HANDLER -> READ8_HANDLER
     WRITE_HANDLER -> WRITE8_HANDLER

- Miscellaneous cleanups and refactorings done primarily to support 
  a new MESS specific feature.  Also removed some '#if 0' code. [Nathan Woods]

- New input port definitions, similar to the new memory map definitions. You can
  continue to use the old PORT_BIT, PORT_BITX, and PORT_ANALOG macros for now, but
  it is preferred going forward that all ports use only PORT_BIT, and append all
  other flags and options using the new macros. See pacman.c for an example of the
  new format. The new input ports also support tagging for easier tracking of ports,
  and the ability to import port definitions from another set. [Nathan Woods]

- Two minor fixes to xml2info so that 'mame -listxml|xml2info' matches 
  'mame -listinfo' exactly. [Logiqx]

- New option in the Windows version: -wavwrite to save sound output to a WAV file. [smf]

- Removed -listinfo option now that xml2info produces fully correct output. [Aaron Giles]

- Added ADSP2181 variant to the ADSP21xx CPU cores. [Aaron Giles]

- Added support for many more instruction forms in x86drc.h. [Aaron Giles]

- Added consistency checking for the year field. [Nathan Woods]

- Removed some silly 6502 speedups in the Atari games. [Aaron Giles]

Nintendo 8080 hardware update [Stefan Jokisch]

The driver has now been split into three parts. A few features that have been missing
in Helifire since my last update are back, i.e. the flickering colors when you're shot
and the volume decay effect (this affects the melody at the start of a game and a few
tunes that can be heard during the bonus scenes every twelve attack waves). The
starfield should now scroll at the correct speed, it's only 75% of what it used to be.
Finally, I have decided to use the color prom from Space Fever in Space Launcher, I
think it's correct.
