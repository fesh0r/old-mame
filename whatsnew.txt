Fixed crash in some games when using a low sample rate or -nosound.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixes crashes in the following drivers: [Aaron Giles]
 * Beat Head (video update)
 * Hit Me (graphics decode)
 * Imago (palette setup)
 * Legend of Kage bootlegs (accessing invalid CPU)
 * Rock Climber
 * Speed Attack (palette out of range)

TumblePop driver updates: [David Haywood]
 * split driver into tumblep.c and tumbleb.c
 * tumblep.c runs the original tumble pop sets and use now using 
    deco16ic.c for the gfx.
 * tumbleb.c runs the bootlegs and games which use hardware which works 
    in a similar way to tumble pop (semicom titles etc.)

Kludged around glitches in Monster World. [David Haywood]

Cross Pang is now using the sprite draw copied from tumbleb.c instead as 
the game also seems to be based around Tumble Pop designs, as a result the 
'Alpha Blend' bit has been removed and replaced with a flicker sprite bit 
like Tumble Pop which looks more correct to me.  Also changed some default 
settings. [David Haywood]

Corrected Indian Battle DIP switches. [ShimaPong]

Updated D-Day DIP switches to use conditionals. [James Wallace]

More Namco sound/MCU updates: [R. Belmont]
 * Fixed analog controls for Ridge Racer and Rage Racer
 * Fixed sound/music to play in System 22 games
 * Fully share the sound part of the MCU RAM for System 11. This allows 
    games to read back the song names and fixes the sound test menu in 
    Tekken and Tekken 2.

[Aaron Giles]

Added discrete emulation of the background music for Indian Battle.
[Derrick Renaud]

Fixed tilemap priorities in Magic Bubble. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Cleaned up MESS hooks into the input port system. [Nathan Woods]

Major Namco sound improvements: [R. Belmont]
 * C352 now sets output pitch correctly by input clock
 * Added emulated sound and music to all NB-1, NB-2,
    and System 11 games, using Prop Cycle's BIOS as a
    substitute until the original can be trojaned or
    otherwise obtained
 * Hooked it up for plain System 22 games as well, but
    they're not interested in passing down proper commands
    for some reason
 * Speed-cheated all instances of the M37710/C352 sound
    system so CPU requirements don't go up much.  This
    also helped back off the requirements a hair for Prop
    Cycle and Time Crisis

Improvements to the ST-V driver: [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
 * dma:  added another checking for dma parameters
 * stv:  changed v-blank timing
 * vdp1: implemented two framebuffers and flipping
 * vdp1: added manual changing and erasing of framebuffers
 * vdp1: added manual trigger for drawing
 * vdp1: mapped framebuffer into memory (for 16bpp only)
 * vdp1: added shadow and half luminance for RGB sprites
 * vdp2: fixed bitmaps scrolling (fixes bad gfx in batmanfr and
    bakubaku intro)
 * vdp2: added preliminary window effect for tilemaps and sprite layer
    (for batmanfr)
 * vdp2: added scaling for 8bpp and 15bpp bitmaps (fixes vmahjong and
    myfairld backgrounds)

Fixed sprite-sprite priorities in toaplan1 games. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed background color in Jolly Jogger. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Made input port conditionals work more generically. This necessitated a bit
of a minor reorg in the input port code. Please verify that controls work as
before. This change has also required a modification to how analog ports are
recorded, so existing INPs may not work. [Aaron Giles]

Minor tweak to fix Time Crisis crash. [Phil Stroffolino]

Fixed spurious vectors in Top Gunner. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Added new functions memory_configure_bank() and memory_set_bank() which
abstract bankswitching better. This allows current memory banking states to
automatically be saved for drivers that use this feature. m62.c games have
been updated to use this new feature as an example. [Aaron Giles]

Completed renaming of core structures. Most pervasive change was "struct
tilemap" is now just "tilemap". [Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the Cinematronics vector games. [Buddabing]

Added blending to the alt tilemap code in psikyosh.c, fixing the final
boss in Sol Divide. [David Haywood]

Improvements to the Witch/Pinball Champ '95 driver: [Sebasten Hegon]
 * The games now show some graphics (the palette seems OK) and play some 
    music and sounds.
 * Since the controls are not yet figured out completely, they are still 
    mapped as dipswitches.
 * An NVRAM reset is required the first time you launch Witch (via the 
    associated dipswitch). Pinball Champ seems to automatically do this.
 * The sound part required some patching in sound/es8712.c. I disabled 
    the hardcoded inconditional looping, and made the sound start when 
    writing at offset 0x06 (cf patch). vmetal does not seem to be affected.
 * As far as gameplay is concerned, the ball will freeze (in game and 
    demo mode), and I don't know why. The video hardware is not completely 
    figured out and may be the culprit.
 * The coin in/out mecanism needs some work too.

Some improvements to Jolly Card: [Roberto Fresca]
 * Added extra hardware info (pinouts and dips).
 * Added the correct dipswitch to Jolly Card. Hopper and Points/pulse not 
    tested due to preliminary driver state. The rest are working properly.
    Remember to delete the nvram and reinitialize to see some changes.
 * Added almost the same dipswitch to Magic Card II (Bulgaria).

Significant changes to the save state system: [Aaron Giles]
 * Added alternate save state pre-/post-load function types that take
    integer or pointer parameters. Updated several sound cores and other 
    files to take advantage of this.
 * Made state handler registrations track like other scoped resources
    (timers, memory) so that registrations can occur as late as 
    MACHINE_INIT time.
 * Added logic to detect registrations after MACHINE_INIT time and prevent
    saves in that case.
 * Added logic to detect when CPUs or sound chips haven't registered 
    anything to save/load. When this happens, info is logged to error.log
    and saves/loads are disallowed.
 * Allocated timers are now automatically saved and restored as part of
    the save state. The global time is now restored as well as a bunch of
    CPU execution state. This should produce more reliable restores.
 * Added logic to defer saves until all anonymous timers have cleared. If 
    a driver uses many anonymous timers it may not be possible to ever 
    successfully save, so the operation will time out after one second.
 * Before restoring, the machine is now reset. This gives a more
    consistent environment for the load to occur.
 * Re-enabled save state support for YM2151.
 * Added save state support to the classic Namco sound system.
 * Added save state support to the samples sound system.
 * Removed anonymous timer usage in machine/scramble.c.

[Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up/normalized the naming of several core structures in an
attempt to impose some order on coding conventions in the core code:
  struct InputPortDefinition   -> input_port_default_entry
  struct InputPort             -> input_port_entry

  struct GfxLayout             -> gfx_layout
  struct GfxElement            -> gfx_element
  struct GfxDecodeInfo         -> gfx_decode
Plus many others along the same lines (follow the pattern). Note that this
work is not yet complete. In addition, a few of the more pervasive structs 
(mame_bitmap, rectangle) will be left until a non-diff release (0.100).
[Aaron Giles]

Removed -skip_disclaimer since it automatically goes away after the first

Created new NMK112 ROM banking module and connected it up to a number of

Updates to the ST-V driver: [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
 - vdp2: added rotation in RBG0 layer (improves diehard, vfkids,
         vfremix, thunt, sassisu backgrounds)
 - vdp2: added 15bit RGB tilemaps (used by thunt)
 - vdp2: added opaque alpha blended bitmaps (fixes missing gfx in
         shienryu intro)
 - vdp2: added enable bit for RGB sprites (fixes some bad sprites in
         vfremix)
 - vdp2: added alpha blending for RGB sprites
 - vdp1: fixed polygon drawing
 - vdp1: added line drawing
 - sh2:  fixed bug in division unit
 - sh2:  added callback called when cpu reads FTCSR register (intended
         for idle loop skipping for slave sh2 in stv)
 - stv:  added idle loop skipping for several games
 - dsp:  fixed dma (fixes some bad gfx in thunt)

Added dsp56k CPU core and hooked it up to the Polygonet Commanders
driver. [Andrew Gardner]

SCSI hard disk updates: [R. Belmont]
 - Added FORMAT UNIT, READ (6 byte), WRITE (6 byte), READ (12 byte), 
    MODE SENSE, and READ CAPACITY commands.
 - Changed INQUIRY to ID as a real Seagate model, which makes MacOS 
    much happier than a manufacturer code of "MAME".
 - Some MESS-specific tweeks to initialization.

Fixed all the volume table calculations in the YMF271 core. [Ville Linde]

SPI Improvements: [Ville Linde, Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
 - Added real coin inputs. The previously used coin input was service coin
 - Hooked up eeprom in rdft2us, rfjetus and rdft22kc

Fixed recent LSI53C810 update which caused the Model 3 games to crash.
[Ville Linde]

Fixed PowerPC recompiler so that Scud Race works again. [Ville Linde]

Significant overhaul of the user interface infrastructure: [Aaron Giles]
 - All user interface rendering is now cached until the end and rendered 
    in one pass.
 - A large number of extraneous and redundant functions have been removed 
    and replaced with a smaller set of more flexible APIs.
 - Global access to the UI fonts and colortables is now gone, they are 
    private to the user interface code.
 - All global user interface function names have been normalized. Most
    importantly, usrintf_showmessage is now ui_popup.
 - Pause behavior has been redefined; instead of sitting in a tight loop,
    the code proceeds normally, but the CPU execution system does not
    advance time.
 - Code for the menus has been reworked; some menus are temporarily not
    available (cheats, memory cards).

Removed the internal display of history.dat. Cramming this kind of data
into MAME's limited UI is not really useful, and viewing the history.dat
information is supported by many frontends and websites. [Aaron Giles]

Removed the following obsolete and/or redundant command line options from 
the Windows build: [Aaron Giles]
 -wrongorientation
 -wrongfps
 -gamelist
 -list
 -listgames
 -listdetails
 -listwrongmerge
 -listcpu

Details of the bad/missing ROMs are still printed to the console.

Prior versions of MAME have excluded some drivers (primarily gambling-
related) for philosophical reasons. Since these games are legitimately at
risk of being lost to the ages, and many of them have strong similarities
to the other sorts of games MAME emulates, it has been decided to allow their
inclusion going forward. The criteria for inclusion in MAME is now simply
"any primarily video based arcade machine, driven by one of more CPUs," and
should relieve any confusion surrounding this issue going forward.

 - Simplified the reading/writing of input ports so they work more reliably.
 - Only write changed settings to the .cfg files.
 - Fixed saving of analog port configurations.

Several Konami improvements: [R. Belmont]
 - Added support for "external memory address" registers on the YMZ280B, 
    which can be used to read the contents of attached ROM or RAM.
 - Hooked up the mask ROM tests in the service menu - both the tile 
    character ROMS and the sound ROMs now can be tested.
 - Added secondary control register.
 - Hooked up IRQ control.
 - Renamed ROMs for both games to include PCB location information.

Some improvements to the DECO cassette games: [Juergen Buchmueller]
 - Treasure Island graphics ROMs (overlay board) mapped according to
    findings by debugging the game code.
 - Swapped image names for ctislnd2 and ctislnd3 to match the driver names;
    ctislnd3 is the not yet working set; removed IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS flag.
 - Found bitswap for Zeroize type #3 dongle; found hack to get it running w/o
    the dongle ROM by debugging the game code; changed year to 1983; removed
    NOT_WORKING flag.

SHARC/Model 2 updates: [Ville Linde]
 - Reworked the SHARC internal ram implementation so that multiple instances 
    of the core work.
 - Added data address space
 - Added coprocessor input and output FIFO's to Model 2.
 - Updated Konami zr107, gticlub, nwk-tr, hornet to work with the SHARC 
    changes

Seibu SPI improvements: [Ville Linde]
 - Fixed sprite priority issues
 - Added support for pen-based alpha to sprites and tilemaps. It's currently 
    using fixed alpha table for all games, but this seems to break some 
    games, so it probably isn't correct.

Fixed the discrete sound 555 timer modules when using actual DC mode.

Fixed crash in mystwarr games. [R. Belmont]

Figured out encryption key for Graplop (set 2). [MASH]

Rewrote the configuration reader/writer code to be more generic and easier
for other subsystems to plug into. This necessitated a rewrite of the way
the existing code reads config data. As a result, your game.cfg files will
be invalid after this update. Your default.cfg and existing controller-
specific .cfg files should work fine. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed all the mystwarr.c games so they pass their service mode mask ROM 
tests, with the exception of Metamorphic Force (it gets hung up on the road
generator ("LVC") test for some reason). [R. Belmont]

Fixed Monster Bash (2-board version) so it works now, though the graphics
are still not perfect. [David Haywood, MASH]

Various improvements to the simple Deco 156 games: [David Haywood]
 - Modified video code to use the functions in deco16ic.c
 - Changed Osman to default to 3 buttons as per Guru's eeprom dump.

Namco System 22 update: [R. Belmont]
 - Hooked up MCU/CPU communications properly
