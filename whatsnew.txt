Source Changes
--------------
-Memory handler normalization, part 1. READ/WRITE_DEVICE*_HANDLERs are
 now passed an address_space &, and the 8-bit variants get a mem_mask
 as well. This means they are now directly compatible with the member
 function delegates. Added a generic address space to the driver_device
 that can be used when no specific address space is available. Also
 added DECLARE_READ/WRITE_DEVICE*_HANDLER macros to declare device
 callbacks with default mem_mask parameters. [Aaron Giles]

-Memory handler normalization, part 2. Change legacy read/write
 handlers to take an address_space & instead of an address_space *.
 Also update pretty much all other functions to take a reference where
 appropriate. [Aaron Giles]

-Memory handler cleanup 3. Add mem_mask parameter to 8-bit handlers to
 match the others. To ease pain, added DECLARE_READ/WRITE_HANDLER
 macros that set up a default parameter. Also updated devcb so that the
 handlers can be called with or without the mem_mask. [Aaron Giles]

-Seibu COP: Added 0x1c param to 0x0205 command, fixes at least sprite
 positioning during intros of Raiden 2 and Zero Team (but breaks
 gameplay in Zero Team, needs investigation) [Angelo Salese, Smitdogg]

-Seibu COP: Made 0x42c2 command more accurate, makes Legionnaire
 enemies to behave properly and match finally starts in Seibu Cup
 Soccer [Angelo Salese, Smitdogg]

-gunpey.c - Corrected OKI M6925 frequency [Phil Bennett]

-fix for "file note writeable" when creating, plus consolidated some
 duplicate/redundant code. [smf]

-Seibu COP: Added 0xe38e command, used by Seibu Cup Soccer to follow
 the ball [Angelo Salese]

-Since nobody checks for NULLs anyway, make
 device_memory_interface::space() assert against NULL and return a
 reference, and pushed references throughout all address space usage in
 the system. Added a has_space() method to check for those rare case
 when it is ambiguous. [Aaron Giles]

-Added -verifysoftware command.  [Wilbert Pol]

-Changed CPS-1 video timings to SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS [Angelo Salese]

-Added generic set of pinball mechanical sounds [Robbbert]

-lib7z: fix portability problems that resulted in memory trashing in
 some configurations. [R. Belmont]

-Better simulation of Metal Slug X's protection device.  [IQ_132]
 Made Epson R4543 RTC a proper RTC device, eliminates duplicated code
 in Namco Systems 12 and 23 [R. Belmont]

-rotation - Added motor simulation; added nvram; added mechanical
 sounds; added notes [Robbbert]

-tms99x8: Converted to using RGB32 bitmap so chips can coexist with
 other video screens [R. Belmont]

-fixed MT03464: fixed potential out of array access in
 src/emu/video/voodoo.c logerror() [Oliver Stöneberg]

-m6509: Fixed EA zero page indirect + Y (post indexed). [Curt Coder]

-Implemented DS75160A/DS75161A IEEE-488 GPIB Transceivers. [Curt Coder]

-spectra - added remaining sounds, game marked as WORKING [Robbbert]

-Ported Palette brightness effects to Raiden 2 HW, used by Zero Team
 and X Se Dae [Angelo Salese]

-mcr68.c: Add dipswitch locations to all sets in the driver.
 [Brian Troha]

-aftor - fixed display, marked as WORKING [Robbbert]

-Added irq ack to Shanghai 3 HW [Angelo Salese]

-Fixed M68K and hooked up SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS for Blocken. Game was
 definitely running at erratic speeds before [Angelo Salese, Tafoid]

-mos6526: Implemented a nearly cycle-exact "old" CIA, which passes most
 of the Lorenz/VICE CIA tests. Refactored the c64/c128/vic10/cbm2
 drivers and the 1571/1581 floppy drives to use the new implementation.
 [Curt Coder]

-6532riot.c: Internal timer is always running. Fixes several a2600
 regressions.  (Wilbert Pol)

-Moved scsi protocol code from scsibus_device to scsihle_device, leaving 
 scsibus_device to calculate the current bus contents and distribute it
 to each of the scsidev_device. [smf]

-suna8.c: fixed sound samples width, improves speech
 in e.g. rranger [Luca Elia]
 
-Promoted starfigh to playable state [Luca Elia]
 * Address line scrambling of data ROMs
 * ROM bank latching and mirroring
 * Sound latch and NMI disable
 * Patched some further protection
 * Added graphics banking

-Emulated Lord of Gun's protection rather than patching it out [iq_132]
