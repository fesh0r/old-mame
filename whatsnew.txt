Please, if you submit dipswitch changes to me make sure they've been tested with a DEBUG compile, fixing
'fixed' dipswitches is time consuming, there are extra warnings when you attempt to run Mame in a DEBUG
compile.

	src/vidhrdw/konamiic.c
	src/vidhrdw/konamiic.h

Various Changes [Nathan Woods]
	src/fileio.c:
	- Introduced a "debug cookie"; when in debug mode, puts a cookie
	value in the mame_file structure to prevent files from being closed
	twice without an assertion

	src/windows/window.c:
	- Fixes a bug in visible area changing in windowed, non-stretch
	mode.  Previously, when the visible area changed, the code would simply
	change the visible area, and look at the resulting window size and tweak
	it accordingly with win_adjust_window().  The problem with this is that
	if you have a sequence where the visible area is made larger, then
	smaller again, what would happen is you wouldn't get the original window
	size; you would simply get the enlarged window with a bunch of buffer
	area.  Now instead of calling win_adjust_window(), I added code that
	preserves the "scale" factors, and the space between the emulation
	rectangle and the window client area.

	src/windows/winddraw.h:
	src/windows/winddraw.c:
	src/windows/wind3d.c:
	- Added a call win_ddraw_fullscreen_margins() that given the
	dwWidth and dwHeight parameters of a DirectDraw surface, comes up with a
	RECT that represents the margins.  For MAME, this is a very simple
	operation (a rectangle from (0,0)-(dwWidth,dwHeight)) (and the
	implementation that I've submitted is corrspondingly simple), but in
	MESS the window can have a menu bar so this operation works differently.
	I've also modified winddraw.c and wind3d.c to use this call.

	src/timer.c:
	src/timer.h:
	- Changes timers so that they are now 'mame_timer *' instead of
	'void *'.  mame_timer is an opaque structure, similar to mame_file in
	fileio.h.  I didn't update any code using timers yet; it doesn't seem to
	me that there isn't a rush and since they used 'void *' before,
	everything compiles just fine.  I hope noone objects to this one.

	src/vidhrdw/jaguar.c:
	- Fixes a potential crash in jaguar_tom_regs_w() (while this
	crash doesn't occur under normal execution of the cojag games though, it
	can occur if modified ROMs are being used).

	src/sound/fmopl.c:
	Added #if/#endif pair

Changed message for Double Clicking on EXE slightly [Leon van Rooij]
	src/windows/winmain.c

Various Sound Improvements to YM2610, YM2608, Y8950 [Jarek Burczynski]
	Inspired by Frits Hilderink (NLMSX emulator author) I attempted to:
	- improve support of the ymdeltat module for the status registers (YM2610,YM2608,Y8950),
	- implement x1bit/x8bit DRAM usage for the ADPCM samples,
	- implement memory read/write via deltat (Y8950 and YM2608)
	- ADPCM synthesis in 'slave' mode (CPU controlled, instead of memory based).

	I made some tests but the changes are quite big so please test them before including. I'm sure the
	Y8950 will be tested by NLMSX authors too.

Fixed i86 DAA opcodes + more [Nathan Woods]
	src/usrintrf.c:
	src/usrintrf.h:
	- Renames display_fps() to ui_display_fps() and makes it
	non-static
	
	src/windows/fileio.c:
	- In osd_fopen(), if a file is opened with mode "r",
	FILE_SHARE_READ will be passed to the dwShareMode parameter of
	CreateFile().  This allows other programs to read any files that MAME
	opens for read only.

Fixed Night Striker dips [Brian A. Troha]

This fixes the bug where SAVE only worked on 8bit cpus in the debugger [smf]
Made dbg_show_scanline the default [Bryan McPhail]
	src/mamedbg.c

Changed a few MAME core files for MESS (shouldn't change Mame behavior) [Nathan Woods]
	src/usrintrf.h:
	src/usrintrf.c:
	- Adds four new calls to control showing the fps count and the
	profiler:
	void ui_show_fps_set(int show);
	int ui_show_fps_get(void);
	void ui_show_profiler_set(int show);
	int ui_show_profiler_get(void);
	
	src/common.h:
	- Adds ROM_LOAD32_DWORD
	
	src/machine/idectrl.c:
	src/machine/idectrl.h:
	src/harddisk.c:
	src/harddisk.h:
	src/hdcomp.c:
	- Enhances the hard disk code to support sector sizes other than
	512 bytes (a non-IDE harddisk in MESS for one of the TI systems uses
	this).  src/machine/idectrl.c has been modified to take this into
	account; it requires that HD images be 512 bytes.  The new code is fully
	backwards compatible with old CHDs that do not have a sector size within
	them.
