Source Changes
--------------
Fixed a few more remaining issues from the 0.101u1 update. 
[Aaron Giles, Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed some bad tiles in naname. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed music tempo in T.N.K.3/T.A.N.K. [R. Belmont, Kold666]

Began adding support for SCRIPTS programs to the 53C810 emulation.
[Nathan Woods, R. Belmont]

Fixed inputs in Passing Shot (Japan). [Ange Albertini, Barry Rodewald]

Added some missing sounds to Wonder Stick and Search Eye. 
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed status flag from MCU in Taito SJ games, fixing the last digit of the
score in Front Line. [Nicola Salmoria]

Many fixes to the SHARC core and Konami PPC drivers. [Ville Linde]

Updated the discrete thump sound in Asteroids to use component values
instead of derived equations. [Hans Andersson, Derrick Renaud]

Added Tilemap0 color banking to esd16. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed save/restore of 8253 PIT. Also several updates to Top Gunner:
[Mathis Rosenhauer]
 * Removed shift register since it just seems to be needed to
    compensate for different DAC speeds
 * Added 8254 PIT from PC emulation
 * Added state saving

Fixed bug in PSX GTE flag settings. [Olivier Galibert]

Fixed 6502 initialization so that all internal states are reset properly.
[Nathan Woods]

Changed the makefile so that debug objects are not compiled on non-debug
builds. [Aaron Giles]

Marked most gfx_layout and gfx_decode structures in the code as const.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed handling of the FR bit in the Status register on MIPS3. This fixes a
few problems in CarnEvil, and probably affects a few other games as well.
Also fixed bug where TLB exceptions were not filling in the Context and
EntryHi registers correctly. [Aaron Giles]

Removed ROMREGION_SOUNDONLY. Since -nosound no longer disables sound CPUs or
sound cores (and hasn't for a while), failing to load sound ROMs was only
leading to crashes. [Aaron Giles]

Implemented pixel-accurate dithering in the Voodoo emulation. [Aaron Giles]

Renamed my_stricmp to mame_stricmp, converted all uses of stricmp in the
code to call mame_stricmp, and #defined stricmp to something invalid to
prevent code from using it in the future. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed implementation of mame_stricmp. [William Krick]

Source Changes
--------------
Added a FIFO for the sound commands in Sega Model 1 driver so they no longer
get lost at startup. Fixed the CPU speed of the 68000. [R. Belmont]

Several fixes and improvements to the C352 sound emulator.
[hoot development team]

Implemented several missing features in the Namco NA sound emulator. [cync]

Added conditional dip switches and a missing dip switch to excelsr.
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed J. League protection workarounds so they work for 2 player games as
well. Also fixed sonic so it works as well as the prototype version (still
major graphics issues). [Anonymous]

Marked several large arrays properly as const. [Atari Ace]

Fixed 6805 core so that CLRA does not modify the carry flag. [Ernesto Corvi]

Fixed sprites wrap around in st0016 (needed in nratechu). 
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Model 3 update: [Ville Linde]
 * Added Daytona USA 2 Power Edition
 * Huge update to the video hardware, including:
    - Transparency support (polygons and textures)
    - Nearly perfect rendering order (something we never got right in 
      Supermodel :-)
    - Parallel lighting
    - Texture coordinate mirroring

Added very experimental rasterizer generator for the Voodoo emulator, which
generates X86 assembly blitters optimized for each case. Unfortunately, it
doesn't help performance much and they are still too buggy so they are
disabled for now. Enable them in the makefile. [Aaron Giles]

Made some of the hack optimizations runtime enableable in the Voodoo
emulator, and added a frameskipper. Use Ctrl+1-6 to control frameskipping,
Ctrl+F/H/Q to run at full/half/quarter resolution. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote most of the validity checks so the full set now completes in well
under 1 second, minus I/O time from paging in data. Also added region
size checking versus memory maps to the validity checks. Moved all validity
checks to a new file validity.c. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the AM_REGION() macro to store region/offset information instead of
a pointer to simplify some of the region valdation code. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed more games broken by the u1 changes. There are only a very small number
of games that are still known to have issues. [Aaron Giles with contributions
from Mathis Rosenhauer]

Improved video rendering and fixed graphics corruption on the final level of
Fairyland Story. [Nicola Salmoria]

Updated the h6280 CPU to use the new address translation system. [Aaron Giles]

Added MAME build information to the listxml output, and updated xml2info to
handle the save state tag. [cutebutwrong]

Updated PSX core to new save state and disassembler interfaces. Updated 
dismips to handle the new disassemblers. [smf]

Removed code that reset the timer when reading/writing on the mk48t08
timekeeper chip. Updated the save state interfaces. Added new macro
state_save_register_item_pointer() for dynamically allocated arrays. [smf]

Updated R3000 core to the new disassembler interfaces. [Aaron Giles]

Added coin counter/lockout and rowscroll banking to the drgnmst driver.
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Source Changes
--------------
Fixed a number of games that were broken with the u1 update. Just a few
more cases remain. Most games are working at this point. [Aaron Giles, with
contributions from El Condor, R. Belmont, Ville Linde]

Added preliminary save state support to Missile Command and Battlezone.
[Buddabing]

Fixed some dips in Pop's Pop's. [Sonikos]

Fixed inputs in Woodpecker. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Updated PowerPC core to use new disassembler style. [Nathan Woods]

Merged in recent updates from MESS PC emulation code. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed DTD in the -listxml output. [Oliver Stoneberg] 

Added sprites banking, tile banking, sound banking, and a couple of
DIP switches to Egg Hunt. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Updated 6502 family of disassemblers to the new disassembler style. Added
internal memory maps for the m6510 and m4510 CPU cores. Updated m4510 to
use address translation hooks. [Nathan Woods]

Reduced how often the debugger display is refreshed if stepping and
steps_until_stop is a high number.  This makes commands like 'step 
#10000' a bit more usable. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed MESS UI code that prevented P and Esc from being intercepted properly.
[Lawrence Gold]

Added check and failure for 0-sized mallocs. [Nathan Woods]

Updated i86 and i286 cores to hook into the new i386 disassembler.
[Nathan Woods]

Added MMU support to the MIPS3 dynamic recompiler. Re-enabled it by default.
Added direct fast RAM access to the dynamic recompiler, as well as optional
hotspot optimizations. Most games should show a net speedup over the pre-MMU
compiler. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed FPU decoding and a few other minor issues in the i386 disassembler.
[Aaron Giles]

Added rudimentary hotspot detection to the debugger. Type "help hotspot" for
details on how it works. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up the way the debugger hooks into the memory subsystem. Now, on each
CPU switch, the debugger queries the memory system for callbacks to be called
on every read/write. This allows more efficient watchpoint tracking and allows
for non-watchpoint debugging behaviors like the hotspot detection.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed the way encrypted CPU memory is allocated and managed. Previously,
memory_set_opcode_base() was used to set a single pointer to the decrypted
opcodes; however this presented a number of limitations. Now that all RAM and
ROM-like regions are assigned banks, the memory system now tracks decrypted
opcodes per bank. For implicit banks (marked RAM or ROM in the memory map),
a new function memory_set_decrypted_region() configures which areas of the
address space contain decrypted opcodes and where the decrypted opcodes live.
For explicit banks, there is a new function memory_configure_bank_decrypted()
which operates identically to memory_configure_bank() but specifies a pointer
to the decrypted opcodes on a per-bank basis. Updated all drivers using the
old mechanism to the new mechanism and removed the old system. [Aaron Giles]

Thanks to the new opcode handling, removed "RAMROM" support from the memory
subsystem altogether, and updated all drivers to simply limit their decryption
to areas that the CPU decrypted. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed activecpu_dasm() and cpunum_dasm() to detect the presence of an updated
disassembler and wraps the calls to that rather than crashing. [Aaron Giles]

Source Changes

Fixed time stamp counter in the Pentium core. [Ville Linde]

Fixed Z80 behavior on cold versus warm reset. [Frank Palazzolo]

Fixed a number of games that were broken due to the recent memory system
changes. There are still more problems to fix; continue reporting them.
[Aaron Giles]

Added support for logical mapping to the CPU interfaces and debugger. CPUs
that have an MMU now need to support several new interface bits, including
a logical address mask and page size for each address space, as well as a
new translate function. There is also a new disassembler interface that
should be used going forward, which will make it much simpler to keep the
disassemblers standalone and not dependent on MAME functions for opcode
accesses. Converted the i386 core to use the new interfaces. [Aaron Giles]

Added MMU support to the non-drc MIPS3 emulator. Converted the Killer
Instinct, Seattle, Vegas, and Hyper Neo-Geo 64 drivers to a proper physical 
memory layout. Disabled the drc MIPS3 core until MMU support is added there 
as well. [Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the S2650 CPU. [Aaron Giles]

Got rid of gross banking hack in the T11 core. Updated Atari System 2 drivers
to accommodate the lack of the hack. [Aaron Giles]

Imported a number of memory handler conversion helpers from MESS, placed 
them in memconv.h. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up i386 disassembler to produce Intel-standard output. [Aaron Giles]

[sonikos]

Fixed Q*Bert knocker connection. [Kevin Jonas]

Some improvements to M37710, C352 and NamcoNA sound. [cync]

Corrected CPS1 frequencies based on measurements from a real PCB.
[Philip Bennett]

Significant change to the memory system. RAM areas are now no longer 
allocated out of the memory_region for a given CPU. This means that drivers
which assume that RAM is located at some offset to the base of the memory
region will be broken. [Aaron Giles]

Added save state information for streams so that dynamic volume changes
get properly restored. Unfortunately this breaks all existing save states.
[Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the HC55516 sound chip. Added save state support
to the Williams sound boards. Added save state support to games in the
mcr3.c and mcr68.c drivers, marking them as GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE. [Aaron Giles]

Changed timer_alloc_ptr-style timers so that the pointer parameter is
supplied at allocation time and is not changeable. This makes these timers
more easily supported in save states. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed missing save state registrations in the m6809 CPU core. [Aaron Giles]

Deferred state loading until all anonymous timers have cleared. This fixes
issues where the timers would fire after the load and would clobber data 
that was just loaded. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up and fully mapped the Williams sound boards. Also added save state
support to them. [Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the classic Williams drivers, marking them as
GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE. [Aaron Giles]
