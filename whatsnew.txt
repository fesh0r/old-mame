Source Changes
--------------
chdcd: Fix crash when parsing bin/cue [R. Belmont]

Rewrite INS8250 to use diserial, updated Microtouch to modern and made
it serial device, updated connected drivers [Carl]

Checksum the delay slot in single-instruction blocks in the MIPS3 and
RSP DRCs. [Ryan Holtz]

mc146818 - Set period even if timer is disabled, required for windows
nt [Carl]

diserial - added optinal rx and tx timers and callbacks [Carl]

ins8250 - serial rx line high on start and fix for msr register [Carl]

m68k: Add API to install a non-debugger instruction hook.  Usage is
strongly NOT recommended except for dire cases.  [R. Belmont]

Williams blits with bit 2 set take approximately 2x as long because
they are bus-shared with RAM. Should impact some timing behaviors such
as later levels in Robotron, where approximately 10% of the blits are
done with bit 2 set. Further refinements may be necessary but this
addresses the most significant issue. [Sean Riddle, Aaron Giles]

i386: One more to fix cmpsb (dir /s in MS-DOS works now) and remove
unused variables. [Carl]

Improvements to Golden Poker driver [Roberto Fresca]
 * Inputs from the scratch.
 * Switched manufacturer 'Playman' to PM / Beck Elektronik, since it's
    PM and Beck Elektronik/Computer/etc...
 * Added technical and game notes.

Added a trivial Y reject to triangle draw commands in the N64 RDP.
[Ryan Holtz]

N64: Various PIF fixes [Ryan Holtz]

info.c: several fixes and additions to listxml output [Fabio Priuli]
 * appended to xml info about devices which can be optionally mounted
    to slots
 * added a description attribute to slotoption to show which devices
    can be mounted in each slot
 * added to xml info of cpus/inputs/image/slots which are relative to
    devices (e.g. CPUs or Dipswitches in the device itself)
 * tags of elements directly attached to the root_device do not
    display anymore the root colon (slot tags were already behaving in
    this way); elements attached to optional devices use tags starting
    with colon (to be interpreted as a relative tags which gets
    appended to the device tag, when such a device is selected in a
    slot)
 * modified when necessary output routines to pass a root_device and a
    root_tag as parameters, in order to simplify output of relative
    devices and avoid duplicated code
 * updated DTD according to the new elements and attributes These
    changes allow frontends to know in advance how drivers can be
    configured through the various slot options (by matching option
    descriptions with device descriptions), without the need to run
    -lx with the various slot combinations. This is especially of use
    if a device adds e.g. dipswitches or image devices (like
    additional floppy drives or additional slot expansions), but also
    if one wants to know e.g. how many sound channels a soundcard
    would add to a pc driver, or which kind of screen parameters would
    be added by a specific choice of video card.

i386: Added 32-bit versions of LMSW, and made LMSW only change the
lower 4 bits of CR0. [Barry Rodewald] 

Fixed Windows 95 blue screen. [Carl]

Preliminary driver for Merkur's 'Mahn Oh-Mann'. German board game
similar to Ludo, derivated from the indian game Parchisi. Coin-op
machine for 1-4 players. No screen, just artwork and lamps.
[Roberto Fresca]

Removed need for *_dev.lst files  [Miodrag Milanovic]
 * enforced short names for slot card devices
 * updated validation, romverify and listxml output accordingly

N64: Force mtc0 opcodes that initiate to-RSP DMAs to end recompile
sequences to force a code check. Fixes certain microcodes from
executing garbage code after DMA. [Ryan Holtz]

N64: Don't flush the RSP DRC cache on DMA. Fixes Mario 64 and others.
[Ryan Holtz] 

N64: Miscellaneous machine fixes [Ryan Holtz]
 * Increase the amount of time consumed by PI DMA, makes certain RSP
    microcodes that test DMA speed land in the correct window.
 * Force the main CPU to yield when the RSP reads its atomic
    semaphore.
 * Force the RSP to yield when PI DMA completes.
 * Flush the RSP DRC cache when touching IMEM with SP DMA.

i386: Prevent page faults when returning to same privilege and
unmapped pages are above the stack.  Windows 95 boots now. [Carl]

Documentation of the video data on Dragon Gun.  [David Haywood]

N64: Fix audio sync issues in Super Mario 64 and probably others, and
also bring PI DMA speed into the realm of reality. [Ryan Holtz]

N64: Change PI DMA speed from 3 cycles/word to 5.08 cycles, as
average PI speed is between 2.53 and 2.55 cycles/byte. [Ryan Holtz]

i386: LOCK prefix should depend on IOPL on 386.  Windows NT beta
boots. [Carl]

gticlub: Rewrote the 3D renderer. Implemented gouraud shading,
lighting and fog. [Ville Linde]

Create a new device_mixer_interface, derived from
device_sound_interface, which mixes all its inputs to a single output
stream. Redefined the SPEAKER device to use this and remove the
duplicate underlying logic. The main purpose of this new interface is
to allow device-ification of an entire sound board, which can itself
become a mixer of all of its sound components to a single output
stream. This stream can then be routed by the device's owner to the
appropriate speakers. A real-life example will show up soon. [Aaron
Giles]

Better management of FLAC block sizes, aiming to keep them around 2k
samples. Increased CD sectors per hunk to 8 for better compression.
[David Haywood]

Re-did the non-CD FLAC codec to be "smart" in that it can choose
either big-endian or little-endian on the fly and uses the best one.
Added FLAC as a default codec for hard disks, which helps a lot for
certain disks. [Aaron Giles]

Added missing proms for Fax and Fax 2. [W. Belk, Smitdogg, The
Dumping Union]

Speedup ratios of 1.6x to 2.8x observed. [Ryan Holtz]

Redone 30test layout, resembling the cabinet more [hap]

Add LZMA codec and .7z container support [David Haywood, R. Belmont]

updated sdl os-core to compile against stock SDL-2.0 [couriersud]
 * The SDL team has moved from 1.3 to 2.0. At the same time, changes
    were made to allow SDL1.2 and SDL2.0 to coexist. All SDL2.0
    include files are now in /usr/include/SDL2.
 * Added sdlinc.h to avoid having tons of #ifdef .. #include in the
    code.
 * Scalemode is no longer a per-window setting
 * Fixed a bug in YUV rendering.
 * Use SDL_GetClipboard (SDL2.0)
 * Updated README_SDL20.txt
Currently, SDL 2.0 is only supported on *nix. Volunteers welcome.

Various N64 stability fixes. [Ryan Holtz]

Steel Talons: Fixed controls and removed the MSP speedup hack which
was causing the game to reset at certain points. [Phil Bennett]

NMK16 priority fixes [Raiden II Project Team]

N64: Partially fix PIF access, several more games recognize cart
SRAM, cart FlashROM, cart EEPROM, and controller paks [Ryan Holtz]

68040: Fix for fsave opcode [O. Galibert]

Added support for (track)balls to osd/sdl. [Couriersud]

Fixed testkeys to work with SDL2.0. Keymaps can now contain SDL1.3 and
SDL2.0 mappings. Updated km-de.txt as an example. [Couriersud]

Major CHD/chdman update: [Aaron Giles]
 The CHD version number has been increased from 4 to 5. This means any
 diff CHDs will no longer work. If you absolutely need to keep the
 data for any existing ones you have, find both the diff CHD and the
 original CHD for the game in question and upgrade using these
 commands:

 rename diff\game.dif diff\game-old.dif chdman copy -i
 diff\game-old.dif -ip roms\game.chd -o diff\game.dif -op roms\game.chd
 -c none

 Specifics regarding this change:

 Defined a new CHD version 5. New features/behaviors of this version:
  * support for up to 4 codecs; each block can use 1 of the 4
  * new LZMA codec, which tends to do better than zlib overall
  * new FLAC codec, primarily used for CDs (but can be applied
     anywhere)
  * upgraded AVHuff codec now uses FLAC for encoding audio
  * new Huffman codec, used to catch more nearly-uncompressable blocks
  * compressed CHDs now use a compressed map for significant savings
  * CHDs now are aware of a "unit" size; each hunk holds 1 or more
     units (in general units map to sectors for hard disks/CDs)
  * diff'ing against a parent now diffs at the unit level, greatly
    improving compression

 Rewrote and modernized chd.c. CHD versions prior to 3 are
 unsupported, and version 3/4 CHDs are only supported for reading.
 Creating a new CHD now leaves the file open.  Added methods to read
 and write at the unit and byte level, removing the need to handle
 this manually. Added metadata access methods that pass astrings and
 dynamic_buffers to simplify the interfaces. A companion class
 chd_compressor now implements full multithreaded compression,
 analyzing and compressing multiple hunks independently in parallel.
 Split the codec implementations out into a separate file chdcodec.*

 Updated harddisk.c and cdrom.c to rely on the caching/byte-level
 read/ write capabilities of the chd_file class. cdrom.c (and chdman)
 now also pad CDs to 4-frame boundaries instead of hunk boundaries,
 ensuring that the same SHA1 hashes are produced regardless of the
 hunk size.

 Rewrote chdman.exe entirely, switching from positional parameters to
 proper options. Use "chdman help" to get a list of commands, and
 "chdman help <command>" to get help for any particular command. Many
 redundant commands were removed now that additional flexibility is
 available. Some basic mappings:

 Old: chdman -createblankhd <out.chd> <cyls> <heads> <secs> New: chdman
 createhd -o <out.chd> -chs <cyls>,<heads>,<secs>

 Old: chdman -createuncomphd <in.raw> <out.chd> .... New: chdman
 createhd -i <in.raw> -o <out.chd> -c none ....

 Old: chdman -verifyfix <in.chd> New: chdman verify -i <in.chd> -f

 Old: chdman -merge <parent.chd> <diff.chd> <out.chd> New: chdman copy
 -i <diff.chd> -ip <parent.chd> -o <out.chd>

 Old: chdman -diff <parent.chd> <compare.chd> <diff.chd> New: chdman
 copy -i <compare.chd> -o <diff.chd> -op <parent.chd>

 Old: chdman -update <in.chd> <out.chd> New: chdman copy -i <in.chd> 
 -o <out.chd>

 Added new core file coretmpl.h to hold core template classes. For now
 just one class, dynamic_array<> is defined, which acts like an array
 of a given object but which can be appended to and/or resized. Also
 defines dynamic_buffer as dynamic_array<UINT8> for holding an
 arbitrary buffer of bytes. Expect to see these used a lot.

 Added new core helper hashing.c/.h which defines classes for each of
 the common hashing methods and creator classes to wrap the
 computation of these hashes. A future work item is to reimplement the
 core emulator hashing code using these.

 Split bit buffer helpers out into C++ classes and into their own
 public header in bitstream.h.

 Updated huffman.c/.h to C++, and changed the interface to make it
 more flexible to use in nonstandard ways. Also added huffman
 compression of the static tree for slightly better compression rates.

 Created flac.c/.h as simplified C++ wrappers around the FLAC
 interface. A future work item is to convert the samples sound device
 to a modern device and leverage this for reading FLAC files.

 Renamed avcomp.* to avhuff.*, updated to C++, and added support for
 FLAC as the audio encoding mechanism. The old huffman audio is still
 supported for decode only.

 Added a variant of core_fload that loads to a dynamic_buffer.

 Tweaked winwork.c a bit to not limit the maximum number of processors
 unless the work queue was created with the WORK_QUEUE_FLAG_HIGH_FREQ
 option. Further adjustments here are likely going to be necessary.

 Fixed bug in aviio.c which caused errors when reading some AVI files.

Fixed an issue with text being missing in some Aleck 64 games. [Ryan
Holtz]

Reduced memory usage in the N64 driver. [Ryan Holtz]
Hook up 64DD RTC and interrupts in the N64 code. [Ryan Holtz, kammedo]

Added warm reset support to N64 hardware [Ryan Holtz]

Fix -romident to work with .7z archives [David Haywood]

Added new CHD codec: CD-FLAC which knows how to shuffle CD data to
more optimally use FLAC. Updated flac wrapper to implement a tell
callback so FLAC can tell us how much we've decoded. Updated chdman to
use CD-FLAC codec in preference over the existing codecs for CDs by
default. [David Haywood]

Fail initializing the CD-FLAC codec if the hunk size is not
CD-compatible. [Aaron Giles]

Centralize detection of existing output files. Add detection (require
--force) for extracted files as well. Move checks outside of try/catch
so that the files are not subsequently deleted. [Aaron Giles]

Move all-0 detection to the write path. Use hunk_info on the
compression path to detect whether the write went through. [Aaron Giles]

Changed sample pack names for alphamc07 -> equites and aristmk4 ->
3bagflvt to match up sample to an actual setname.  [Tafoid]

dma8237: fix uninitialized variable [Hans Ostermeyer]

mc146818: remove previous Apollo hack, fix 32768 Hz. updates
[Hans Ostermeyer]

m68k: fix FSGLMUL/FSGLDIV plus some minor MMU improvements
[Hans Ostermeyer]

m68k: slightly less stubby CINV [Hans Ostermeyer]

namcos23: documentation update [Guru]

vamphalf.c: Added correct speed up to Diet Family [Dave Haywood]

Assorted N64 SP/DP/CPU comms accuracy fixes. [Ryan Holtz]

Rewrote SAMPLES as a modern device. Updated all callers. FLAC reading
is now done using the FLAC wrapper. There is now a samples_iterator
class to centralize the logic for handling the sample list walking.
[Aaron Giles]

Redid the cheesy half-baked votrax device since it relied on some
old samples-based handling. Until we have a real implementation, it
would be good to route the various clients through the current one to
at least wire it up properly, even if it just plays samples in the
end. Will look into that shortly. [Aaron Giles]

Added windows implementation of pseudo tty access functions over pipes
[Carl]

Fixed N64 RDP to not try to render a triangle with no spans.
[Ryan Holtz]

Sega Model 2 update: [Brian Troha]
* Dumped and hooked up Dynamite Baseball
* Dynamite Baseball 97 renamed as dynabb97
* Properly renamed 4 MASK ROMs in dynabb97 to match pcb manual
* Minor cleanups and fixes
