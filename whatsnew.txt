- 04027: [Crash/Freeze] All sets in 20pacgal.c: Game does not 
         successfully boot (Aaron Giles)
- 04111: [DIP/Input] timesold, timesold1, btlfield: Coins are not

         does not boot (Mariusz Wojcieszek)



Source Changes
--------------
Fixed problems with i2cmem. Cubo CD32 games now save and load settings
properly. [Mariusz Wojcieszek]

Cleaned up many duplicate inputs and fixed others in a number of
drivers.  [Tafoid]

SDL: Support -uifont for using arbitrary TrueType fonts on Linux/BSD
builds. This takes full pathname/filename to the font, and the name 
can have styles appended as in Windows: [b] for bold, [i] for italic, 
[s] for strikethrough, and [u] for underlined.  Fonts are rendered at 
a size of 120 points and scaled down by the core, which looks superb 
on high-res displays.  (Liberation Sans that comes with most recent
distros looks really good). [R. Belmont]

   Warning: Linux/BSD builds now require SDL_ttf 2.x.  On Fedora the
   required package names are "SDL_ttf" and "SDL_ttf-devel".

tms7000: Corrected two opcodes: typo in inv_b and JPZ was wrong in
official TI document. [Gilles Fetis]

SDL: -uifont now can also look up system font families like Windows
[R. Belmont]

Take some driver_device classes that cover multiple drivers and 
split them so that each driver gets their own driver_device class.  
In most cases, these drivers got entangled because of audio/mcu code 
that was shared between multiple drivers: [Atari Ace]

 * espial/marineb/zodiak
       - common code duplicated
 * m52/m57/m58/m62/travrusa
       - common code in audio/irem.c
 * junofrst/pooyan/rallyx/rocnrope/timeplt/tutankm
       - common code in audio/timeplt.c
 * hyperspt/sbasketb/trackfld/yiear
       - common code in audio/trackfld and audio/hyprolyb.c
 * 40love/bking/buggychl/msisaac
       - common code in machine/buggychl.c

SDL: OS X support for -uifont [Tim Lindner]

SDL: Build fixes for Ubuntu, -uifont non-ASCII rendering fix
[R. Belmont, Barry Rodewald]

Added bare bones irq support to V810 CPU [Miodrag Milanovic]

Striker III is now possible. [Andreas Naive]

Fixed interrupt handing in V810 core,and flag position in PCW
[Miodrag Milanovic]

SDL: add ptty (*IX/OS X) and sockets (all SDL builds) capability
[Tim Lindner, R. Belmont]

Added Button 3 to the original Yie Ar Kung-Fu boardsets.  While not
shown in manual, there is function for these buttons and the emulation
should account for this possibility. Mapping is off by default.
[Tafoid]

CPS-1 updates [Team CPS-1]:
 * Added The King of Dragons (World 910805) and set as new parent

    labels where wrong and added pcb infos to video\cps1.c
 * Removed incorrect roms relationship between parent/clones in
    ffightj, ffightj1, ffightj2 and cawingj
 * Minor cleanups and fixes

Replaced smgolfb with correct dump
[D. Beneke, M. David, Smitdogg, The Dumping Union]

MESS fixes: [Miodrag Milanovic]
 * Fixed issue with image empty slot
 * Default for writeconfig is now 0 for MESS since it is not needed
    anymore
 * Fixed handling of mounted devices on hard reset
 * Unified some emuopts code, and removed ifdefs

Corrected several rom names in the Sega System32 driver.  Most notably
the correct revision for Spider-man & Golden Axe II US sets.
[The Dumping Union]

Hooked up MSM5205 sample playback routines to Rougien, disabled by
default because sample start write handler is still a mystery
[Angelo Salese]

Updated Naomi/Naomi2 M2/M3 encryption. [Andreas Naive]

Fix F4 shortcut so it explicitly labels the address as a number by
preceding it with "0x". This allows F4 to work properly, for example,
on the 68000 stepping to address a6, which also happens to be a
register name. [Aaron Giles]

More updates to Naomi/Naomi2 M2/M3 decryption. [Andreas Naive]

Added proper sample playback in Rougien [Andrew Welburn, Angelo
Salese]

Split the screen device into a separate module. Converted global video
routines into a video_manager. Moved video manager initialization
earlier in startup. [Aaron Giles]

Allowed the use of either decimal or hexadecimal values for <dataarea>
size, <rom> size, and <rom> offset in software lists. [Curt Coder]

Updated the Space Stranger overlay layout by adding the overlay for
the Upright version, which looks different to the Cocktail.

MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
- 04096: [DIP/Input] sjryuko: Most inputs do not work (Angelo Salese)
- 02561: [Interface] Ability to choose a different name for the UI 
         font (Aaron Giles)



Source Changes
--------------
Create new class osd_interface to house OSD callbacks. Added new
module osdepend.c with default empty implementations. Changed
mame_execute() and cli_execute() to accept a reference to an
osd_interface which is provided by the caller. [Aaron Giles]

Updated SDL and Windows OSD to create an osd_interface-derived class
and moved their OSD callbacks to be members. [Aaron Giles]

Make osdmini build again. [Aaron Giles]

Discrete Sound - Added DISCRETE_XTIME_xxx logic modules.  These allow
you to do logic operations on nodes that use x_time anti-alias info. 
Added the ability to decode x_time to the DISCRETE_BIT_DECODE module. 
This means you can have an oscillator pass x_time onto a counter, get
the counter bits decoded, pass that through the new logic modules and
also have them convert the x_time to energy/anti-alaised voltage. 
Updated Donkey Kong Jr. to use these new modules. [Derrick Renaud]

Convert rendfont to C++. [Aaron Giles]

[SDL Debugger] Removed an unnecessary assert and brought focus back to
the main debugger window on startup. [Andrew Gardner]

Added support for OSD-generated fonts. The OSD is queried first to see
if it owns a given font (based on the name), and if it does, it is
responsible for generating bitmaps on the fly as characters are
requested. [Aaron Giles]

Added new option -uifont to specify the UI font. It can be set to a
filename, in which case a BDF font will be loaded. It can also be set
to a font name (assuming the OSD support is present), in which case
the OSD font by that name is used. The default value is 'default'
which can be used by the OSD to substitute a default font or by the
OSD, which will default to ui.bdf as before. In all cases, it falls
back to the built-in font by default if none of the previous options
works. [Aaron Giles]

  NOTE: On Windows, the OSD will default to Tahoma as the font name. 
  Also on Windows, font names can be specified with [b] to indicate 
  bold or [i] to indicate italic.

Use "default" font for artwork elements as well. Make UI backgrounds a
bit more opaque. Fix crash when passing NULL filename to OSD code.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed and verified with Test Mode the few System 18 bootlegs located
in the system16.c driver for Inputs and Dip Switches. [Tafoid]

Discrete Updates [Derrick Renaud] 
 * Removed old DISCRETE_74LS624 code and replaced it with new 74LS629 
    based code. Updated Mario to use new DISCRETE_74LS624 and 
    DISCRETE_XTIME_logic modules.

C++-ified the cheat engine. [Aaron Giles]

Naomi updates:
 * Redumped Kick 4 Cash to fix bad dumps [f205v] 
 * Completed dump of Neo Geo Battle Coliseum [Guru]

i286.c: Moved call of i80286_urinit to CPU_INIT. Fixed display of PC
in the debugger.  [Wilbert Pol]

M6805: Add extremely preliminary 68HC05EG support. [R. Belmont]

i80186/i80286: Fixed bound instruction restart when prefixed with a
segment.  [Wilbert Pol]

i286.c: Partially implemented protected mode. Fixed verw, verr, lar,
lsl, and arpl instructions.  [Wilbert Pol]

Atari Cops'n Robbers Updates [Derrick Renaud]
 * Converted controls to Positional type. 
 * Started Discrete sounds. (Motor 2 & 3, Crash sounds implemented)
 * Added Motor 0 & 1, and Zings sounds. Zings sound not hooked up until 
    address for Fires & Zings is found.

Optimized speed of DISCRETE_DAC_R1 [Derrick Renaud]

Converted the expression engine to C++, did the usual cleanup.
[Aaron Giles]

Neo Geo Changes: [Johnboy] 
 * maglord/maglordh - Mixed up crc's, fixed 
 * flipshot - Added correct p1
 * kotm2 - Tagged MVS AND AES VERSION
 * miexchng - Added correct c3/c4
 * Updated game pcb info
 * Continued to document mask ROM types

Fixed crash in cubocd32/akiko [Mariusz Wojcieszek]

Atari Cops'n Robbers Updates [Derrick Renaud] 

Fixed operation of DISCRETE_COUNTER_7492 [Derrick Renaud]

kofxi: Redumped mask ROMs due to error in TSOP70 adaptor [Cah4e3]

Added UTF-8 constants for cursor key arrows, and accented characters
on the Swedish/Finnish keyboard layout. [Curt Coder]

Removed deprecat.h usage and rewritten irq routines in DJ Boy
