multiscreeninfo0123u2gre [Aaron Giles]



Source Changes
--------------
Corrected clock speeds for the megasys1.c boards. Yes, the games
actually ran _THAT_ slow! [Brian Troha]

Makefile & build system update: [couriersud]
 * verinfo: New syntax. verinfo now uses the following syntax: 
     verinfo.exe -b windows|winui|mess. 
   Does not depend on compile time defines any longer.
 * makefile will include src/osd/$(CROSS_BUILD_OSD)/build.mak if it 
   exists. This was necessary to enable cross builds for winui. 

Cloak & Dagger video code cleanup: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - resnet conversion - colors are now signficantly less saturated 
    because of the 1K pull-ups. This is noticable in the agent's coat 
    and the sky color, for example.
 - Added bitmap palette selection based on the 128H line. Not sure 
    where this is actually used in the game.

Removed unnecessary machine->pens[] lookups in a large number of
drivers. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added built-in layout to Space Tactics. Cleaned up and reorganized the
driver. [Mr. Do!, Zsolt Vasvari]

Switched the funworld color decoding routines to use resnet code.
[Roberto Fresca]

Fixed namcos2, namcos21 crashes due to nvram allocation in 
MACHINE_RESET. Created MACHINE_START and move allocation there.
[couriersud]

Updated info.c to output raw video parameters (pixclock, htotal, 
hbend, hbstart, vtotal, vbend, vbstart) via -listxml if they have 
been given. [couriersud]

Removed some deprecat.h includes from osd layer: [couriersud]
 * add machine as parameter to osd_update and osd_update_audio_stream
 * change Machine to machine and remove include deprecat.h

Added a rule in vconv.c to make VS2008 compile seamlessly. 
[Aaron Giles]

bionicc.c: [couriersud]
 * Added cpu clocks from schematics
 * Comment about z80 nmi generation

Fixed the DAC sound in X The Ball. [Zsolt Vasvari, Mamesick]

Removed the confirmed bad dump of Virtua striker 2 2000. [Brian Troha]

Fixes crash in Raiga. [Zsolt Vasvari, David Haywood]

drawgfx.c improvments: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - Added some asserts to drawgfx and drawgfxzoom
 - Moved some variable declarations so that they are only visible 
    where they are actually used

Removed 8bpp bitmap support from drawgfx. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Removed MDRV_PALETTE_LENGTH from vector games, which would trigger 
an assert in emupal.c (debug build) [couriersud]

Added new module: tokenize.h. This centralizes the behavior of
tokenizing data structures, as currently used by the input port 
system. Redid the input port tokenization to be more compact and make 
use of the new macros. Added support for designated initializers in
C99 and GCC builds to enforce type safety. [Aaron Giles]

Removed bogus DIPs from the NSS driver. [R. Belmont]

Improved the global "flip_screen" macros and variables: [couriersud]
 * fix issues related to flip_screen being a define
 * add "int flip_screen_get(void)"
 * clean up drivers with collisions 
 * remove flip_screen macro
 * flip_screen_x and flip_screen_y made static
 * add flip_screen_x_get() and flip_screen_y_get()
 * change writes to flip_screen_x to flip_screen_set_no_update()
 * added save state calls for flip_screen_x and flip_screen_y

Converted MACHINE_DRIVER definitions from function constructors to 
tokenized lists. For the most part this is a non-invasive change, 
except for those drivers using MDRV_WATCHDOG_TIME_INIT. In order to 
allow for tokenization of attotimes, a set of new macros is provided 
called UINT64_ATTOTIME_IN_x() which follows the same pattern as 
ATTOTIME_IN_x() but packs the attotime down into a single 64-bit 
value for easier tokenization. Fixed several errors in the machine 
drivers which were caught by the additional checks now done in the 
machine config detokenization code. [Aaron Giles]

Separated MDRV_DEVICE_CONFIG_DATA into 32-bit and 64-bit versions. 
Added floating-point versions with configurable resolutions. 
[Aaron Giles]

Converted speakers into devices. Machine->config no longer houses 
an array of speakers; instead they are iterated through using the 
new macros (defined in sound.h) speaker_output_first() and 
speaker_output_next(). Updated all relevant code to do this.
[Aaron Giles]

Added typedefs for all the machine config callback functions at the 
top of driver.h. [Aaron Giles]

Big changes to Cal Omega driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Renamed the driver to calomega.c.
 - Extended the driver to support all the other Cal Omega systems.
 - Switched to XTAL def.
 - Fixed CPU & sound clocks based on official diagrams.
 - Replaced the AY-8910 with AY-8912 to match the real hardware.
 - Unified some memory maps.
 - Splitted machine in sys903 and sys905.
 - Fixed memory map offsets for sys905.
 - Added a list of official/unofficial games, and their states.
 - Fixed a bug introduced when extended the color PROM region to 
    eliminate colortable length.
 - Updated technical notes.

Merged memory maps for a number of drivers beginning with a digit or
the letter 'a'. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up the Crazy Climber video driver, mainly via tilemap 
conversion. This fixes the ape sprite positioning in Crazy Kong - no 
more gap between feet and platform. Merged Yamato driver with Crazy 
Climber. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Converted XX Mission to tilemaps. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Removed VIDEO_START(generic) - no longer used. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added PGM.c EEPROM/hiscore saving. [Creamymami]

Added support for original Omega Race state PROM. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Added support in the MC6845 emulation for cursors. All 4 blinking 
modes are supported. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added a stub implementation of the Rockwell 6545. [Nathan Woods]

Added basic support for the NEC uPD7801, uPD78C05, and uPD78C06 CPUs 
to the uPD7810 cpu core. [Wilbert Pol]

Some improvements to the 6850 ACIA CTS pin checking logic and the MPU4
ACIA clock logic. [James Wallace]

Another Risky Challenge opcode to fix a sprite bug and a general 
clean up of the remarks in the driver. [robiza]

Added dip locations to astinvad, bonzeadv, cadash, asuka, mofflott, 
galmedes, atarifb, atarifb4, abaseb, soccer. Added DIP locations and 
improved DIP switches in seawolf2, wow, gorf, robby, profpac. 
[RansAckeR]

One-line fix for the z80pio. At the moment when the interrupt control 
word is sent (with interrupts enabled), an interrupt occurs. In 
reality, interrupts are disabled until the interrupt mask byte is 
sent. [Robert]

MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
progear0123u1gra [stephh]



Source Changes
--------------
csk.c driver improvements: [Mirko Buffoni]
 * Added DIPLOCATION macros to all Dip Switches. All DSW are verified 
    through test mode.
 * Fixed custom_io_r which is used for protection but also for 
    keyboard input.

Fixed build with external zlib. [R. Belmont]

Completed old-style colortable removal. Removed 
MDRV_COLORTABLE_LENGTH macro. Updated uigfx to display new-style
color tables if present. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Reorganized/minor clean-ups to Mad Alien driver. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed Xenophobe sprite aligment. [Derek Ledbetter]

Converted SNES (except debug code) to RGB32 as it was a serious 
abuser of the palette system. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added colortable_palette_get_size() to emupal. Added some more 
asserts to catch errors. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed Dip Switches (especially coinage) and inputs for 'mpatrol' and 
'troangl' (and their clones). Tried to "unify" the two drivers (I 
still think that some things can be merged). Added iremipt.h source 
file (same purpose as taitoipt.h). Fixed Dip Switches and inputs for 
'alpha1v'. The game is now more playable to me but I left the 
GAME_NOT_WORKING flag as I think there are still some things to look 
at). [stephh]

Changed IREM cpu decryption to be 'real-time' (it's a feature of the 
CPU). Moved decryption table setup to 'config' struct for the CPU.
Added latest tables from robiza, making Risky Challenge playable, 
promoted it to working. Told CPU core to not decrypt code after 
brkn instruction, enabling it again on iret, allowing me to remove 
several 'don't decrypt range' hacks in the code. Updated all drivers 
accordingly. Currently the disassembly is a bit weird now, this will 
need looking at. [David Haywood, robiza]

Added and hooked up AICA (Naomi sound chip). Naomi boot sounds now 
play. Since it's an SCSPx2 with ADPCM instead of FM it's already 
feature-complete except filter envelopes. A bug in the ARM7 core 
causes incorrect pan/level values to be computed in e.g. the Naomi 
SOUND TEST menu. This is not a defect in the AICA.
[ElSemi, Deunan Knute, kingshriek, R. Belmont]

Fixed Dip Switches (especially coinage) and inputs for '10yard' (and 
its clones). Tried to "unify" the driver with m52 and m57 drivers 
(I still think that some things can be merged). [stephh]

Fixed unaligned 32-bit reads in the ARM7 core. [R. Belmont]

Fixed misaligned backgrounds in mpatrol caused by recent changes.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Minor code cleanups. Added static/const where appropriate, plus some 
include fixes. Reverted some of the changes to build.mak from u1 
which made some MSVC builds fail, and adjusted/optimized an m10.c 
gfx_layout. Added some missing cores to cpuintrf.c, sndintrf.c and 
added some missing #if's to 5220intf.c. [Atari Ace]

Fixed one or two dips in the mirage.c driver and found the "service" 
switch and likely start of inputs. [Brian Troha]

Removed expand_machine_driver(). Replaced with machine_config_alloc() 
and machine_config_free(). Updated all call sites. Normalized info.c 
style and simplified some of the code. [Aaron Giles]

Renamed machine->drv to machine->config to reduce overloading of the
term "driver". [Aaron Giles]

Simplified collision detection in taitosj and tank8. [Zsolt Vasvari]

New module: devintrf.c/.h. Implements a generic device interface 
similar to the sound and CPU interfaces. [Aaron Giles]

New module: mconfig.c/.h. Moved all machine_config and MDRV_* macros 
here, out of driver.c/.h. Added MDRV macros for adding/removing/
configuring devices. [Aaron Giles]

Deprecated the following constants because global constants that 
pretend to document things but which are only guesses are dumb:
  - DEFAULT_60HZ_VBLANK_DURATION
  - DEFAULT_30HZ_VBLANK_DURATION
  - DEFAULT_REAL_60HZ_VBLANK_DURATION
  - DEFAULT_REAL_30HZ_VBLANK_DURATION
  - DEFAULT_60HZ_3S_VBLANK_WATCHDOG
  - DEFAULT_30HZ_3S_VBLANK_WATCHDOG
Updated all drivers to explicitly specify the equivalent bogus 
times. Added comments for the "REAL" VBLANK durations to indicate 
that they are not accurate. [Aaron Giles]

Improved some DIP switches, added some DIP locations, replaced 
IPT_COINx with IPT_SERVICE1 where appropiate, and simplified some 
control definitions in the following drivers: alpha68k.c, actfancr.c,
aeroboto.c, aerofgt.c, aliens.c, ambush.c, amidar.c, amspdwy.c,
angelkds.c, appoooh.c, arabian.c, argus.c, arkanoid.c. [RansAckeR]

Connected the Shadow Warriors buttons like they are wired on the 
original pcb (which is jamma). [Corrado Tomaselli]

Added DIP locations to: cclimbr2 , legion, terraf, ultennis, cheesech,
stonebal, stoneba2,  scessjoe, ashnojoe, asteroid, llander, llander1,
astdelux. [RansAckeR]

Fixed multi-session crash with Namco System 2 games. [Atari Ace]

Improved Print Club DIP switches. [Edward Swiftwood]

Fixed a few corner cases in the 6840 emulation based on running the 
MPU4 test ROMs, and added the ability to dynamically alter the 
external clock frequencies in game. [James Wallace]

Changed the 6850 core to allow dynamic RX and TX clock alteration, 
to at least try to remove a few of the MPU4 timing problems.
[James Wallace]

Updated documentation of the MPU4 Video board. Added documentation of
the Cosmic Chasm crystals, and merged the memory maps. [James Wallace]

Fixed validation fail of '_mul_32x32_hi()' and '_mulu_32x32_hi()' 
inline function when compiled GCC v3.3.5 with I686 optimization.
[KO Myung-Hun]

Verified clocks on Rainbow Islands and Rambo 3 and Raiden 2. Reverted 
sound OSC of Truxton 2 to 27mhz/8 since the original OST runs at this 
speed. The pcb I measured the previous clock was 28mhz/8 and it's a 
different pcb version from the common one. Since mame doesn't support 
multiple OSC I prefer to use the 27mhz one. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Fixed some incorrect rom dumps for Double Dragon 3 (Some of the dumps 
were based of the bootleg and not the original.) and updated the name 
and location to actually match that of a real board. [Kevin Eshbach]

Added DIP locations to Combatribes and Battletoads. [Kevin Eshbach]

Added video_screen_update_now(int scrnum) to force a screen update up 
to the current beam position. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Pulled remaining vestiges of old-style colortables: [Aaron Giles]
 * PALETTE_INIT no longer has a colortable parameter
 * removed game_colortable and remapped_colortable from machine_config
 * updated a few stragglers that still referenced these fields
 * removed tile_draw_colortable from tilemap.c

Changed the input port tokens to use a union instead of casting 
everything to FPTR. In the future, C99-enabled compilers will be able 
to achieve type safety with designated initializers. [Aaron Giles]

Added i8749 CPU variant for MESS. [Curt Coder]

Added missing SH4 instructions and bugfixed the FPU. Improved Naomi
I/O board emulation and added working controls. [Samuele Zannoli]

jedi.c improvements: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - Complete memory map
 - Crystals
 - Driver state structure
 - Text layer is rendered at the same time as the background

Reorganized Qix driver (driver state, decoupled audio section, etc.)
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Changed all drivers using the MC6845 chip to use the new device 
interface. Removed mc6845_config. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Reorganized Gameplan driver. Changed Trivia Quest use the Gameplan 
video code. Added crystal for Gameplan pixel clock. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Removed the unnecessary pen array lookup from some INDEXED16 drivers.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Removed the per-screen palette_base. This was an idea that never
really worked out, nor have we really needed it. [Aaron Giles]

Defined a new device type VIDEO_SCREEN. Currently this has no
live functionality, but merely serves as a placeholder/identifier
for video screens. Eventually some of the screen management code
may move into the start/stop/reset functions. [Aaron Giles]

Changed MDRV_SCREEN_ADD to specify a screen type (RASTER, VECTOR,
LCD for the moment). Removed the older VIDEO_TYPE_RASTER and 
VIDEO_TYPE_VECTOR; this information is now determined by walking 
the screen list. [Aaron Giles]

Changed MDRV_SCREEN_* macros to build up VIDEO_SCREEN devices
rather than storing values in the screen[] array. Removed the 
screen[] array from machine_config. Modified all code referencing 
Machine->config->screen[] and changed it to iterate over the devices 
using the new video_screen_first() and video_screen_next() 
functions. [Aaron Giles]

Removed implicit screen #0. This means that ALL DRIVERS MUST
EXPLICITLY DECLARE THEIR SCREENS. Updated all drivers to do
so. While there, grouped all MDRV_SCREEN_* parameters together.
Also removed unnecessary VIDEO_TYPE_RASTER and VIDEO_TYPE_VECTOR.
Also removed VBLANK and bitmap format information from vector
games. This was painful and very tedious. [Aaron Giles]

Changed game information to display info about all screens. 
[Aaron Giles]

Changed Beathead driver to use partial updates instead of caching 
scanline level information. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added state_save_combine_module_and_tag(). Its purpose is to create 
a unique name for state saving purposes in modules that are tag 
based (no index). [Zsolt Vasvari]

 * fix dkong audio over-modulation issue with DAC sound
 * surround the fix with a DK_REVIEW define for later review.

Changed the use of machine->remapped_colortable to machine->pens where
the drivers weren't using color tables. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Corrected the clocks on the following pcbs: Formation Z, MagMax, 
SlapFight and Tiger Heli. Changed Oki m6295 pin 7 to "high" on Toki 
and Blood Bros. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Improve build independence for CPU/sound cores. Rescued the M65CE02 
core from bitrot hell, and fixed some MESS cores that were broken by 
the deprecat.h changes. [Atari Ace]

Corrected the initial detection of extended INP files. 
[Barry Rodewald]

Moved Galaxy Games emulation to tmaster.c. [Luca Elia]

makefile/build updates: [couriersud, Aaron Giles]

[Zsolt Vasvari]

Split timer_adjust() into timer_adjust_oneshot() and 
timer_adjust_periodic(). Updated all call sites. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed some arkanoid clones INPUT_PORTS definitions that were curiously 
using PORT_START_TAG("DSW") instead of PORT_MODIFY("DSW"). [stephh]

Fixed DIP switches and inputs for all games in cvs.c. [stephh]

Added HOTD2-specific BIOSes. [Arzeno Fabrice]

Added more accurate emulation of the priority system and the beam
logic in stactics. Removed color table. Centered crosshair. Used
proper game orientation. Unified memory maps. Switched game to use the
artwork system. Set GAME_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS until artwork is created.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Added sound support to Champion Skill. Removed GAME_NO_SOUND flags.
Increased interrupts per frame, music was too slow. Minor comments 
adjustment. [Mirko Buffoni]

Used PORT_SERVICE and PORT_SERVICE_NO_TOGGLE macros when it was 
possible. [stephh]

In the cps2 driver, Changed the GAME definitions to reflect how many 
players and how many buttons there are for each game. Rewrote the 
INPUT_PORTS definitions to use PORT_INCLUDE, PORT_MODIFY and 
PORT_CUSTOM macros. Added a few notes about the inputs when I thought 
they were needed to avoid wrong bug reports. Started to clean the 
driver. [stephh]

Added PCB and/or chip docs updates for Blaze On (kaneko16.c),
Sand Scorpion (sandscrp.c), Flash Point (segas16b.c). [Brian Troha]

Fixed kangaroo colors by assuming an inversion not present in the
schematics. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added the ability to pass absolute paths to mame_schedule_save() and 
mame_schedule_load(). [Nathan Woods]

Naomi/DC updates: [Samuele Zannoli]
 - Add SH4 I/O ports
 - Connected the 93C46 of the naomi and the x76f100 of the rom board 
    and filled them with dummy data to satisfy the BIOS

MC6845 updates: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - changed the 6845 to be handle based -- adjusted all drivers
 - renamed crtc6845 to mc6845
 - allow reading registers 12 and 13
