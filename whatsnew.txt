General Source Changes
----------------------

Fix to allow a driver to have MSM6295s and plain ADPCM voices coexist
(required for gcpinbal).  [R.Belmont]
	src/sound/adpcm.c

Full Sound / Music in Grand Cross [R.Belmont]
	src/drivers/gcpinbal.c


Improved Bishi Bashi colours [Angelo Salese]
	src/drivers/bishi.c
	src/palette.c
	src/palette.h

Fixed ckongs sprites [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Updated Double Dragon Driver [Bryan McPhail]
	- Correct video & interrupt timing derived from Xain schematics
	and confirmed on real DD board.

	- Corrected interrupt handling, epecially to MCU (but one
	semi-hack remains).

	- TStrike now boots but sprites don't appear (I had them working
	at one point, can't remember what broke them again).

	- Dangerous Dungeons fixed.

	- World version of Double Dragon added (actually same roms as
	the bootleg, but confirmed from real board)

	- Removed stereo audio flag (still on Toffy - does it have it?)

	src/drivers/ddragon.c

Various ST-V improvements [Angelo Salese]
	src/drivers/stv.c

Twin16/TMNT fixes [Curt Coder]
	drivers/twin16.c

	- Fixed cuebrick NVRAM handler
	- Added watchdog reset

	drivers/tmnt.c

	- Fixed mia/mia2 inputs/dips
	- Fixed visible area in cuebrckj/mia/mia2
	- Changed cuebrckj to "Cue Brick (World version D)", since text
	  is in English)

TMS32031 Fixes [Aaron Giles]
	many fixes to the TMS32031 core; Offroad Challenge is almost playable as a
	result, minus the fact that the clipping plane seems to like clipping out
	the cars during the race. But the terrain problems are fixed at least.

Memory Annoyance Fix [Aaron Giles]
	Unmapped memory accesses always reported the raw byte address, not the
	CPU-level address. This is annoying for chips like the TMS34010 or the
	TMS32031, so now the effecitve offset is logged instead, taking into account
	the address shift.

Some Input Port Corrections [Robin Merrill, fixed by Bryan McPhail]

OSD Fix [Aaron Giles]
	This is a minor fix to enable the OSD for non-debug builds regardless of
	the -debug flag

Misc Fixes [Nathan Woods]
	src/usrintrf.c:
	- Adds a handful of comments to uifontdata[]

	src/drivers/xain.c

New Games supported or promoted from GAME_NOT_WORKING status:
-------------------------------------------------------------

Several ST-V games are probably now playable, however be warned many are very very
slow, this is not a bug, sound is still poor or non-existant in most titles, these
haven't been tested for long so could easily fail at later levels.  Games which
were marked as working in previous updates are also improved (shienryu etc.)
	[David Haywood, Angelo Salese, Olivier Galibert]

	Puyo Puyo Sun - some priority glitches, otherwise looks good
	Mausuke Ojama the World - mostly ok
	Ejihon Tantei Jimusyo - missing alpha effect on lens
	Virtua Fighter Kids - bad sprite colours, missing ground effects
	Columns 97 - miscoloured sprites, background not correctly scaled
	Cotton 2 - missing ground in places
	Cotton Boomerang - missing ground in places
	Die Hard Arcade / Dynamite Deka - missing floors / ceilings

	there might be others too, a few can certainly be watched.  this driver still
	needs a lot of work, I don't expect it to be completed soon due to the
	incredible complexity of this hardware.

Sega Dual Space Attack / Head On Dual board [Stefan Jokisch]
	src/drivers/vicdual.c


New Non-Working games / clones supported
----------------------------------------
	
Quiz Panicuru Fantasy [David Haywood]
	haven't found any time for this in the last 6 months so included it anyway
	so it doesn't get lost, if anybody wants to finish it they're welcome
	src/drivers/quizpani.c

0.76u1

General Source Changes
----------------------

Ported ElSemi's SCSP Core, this gives preliminary sound in the ST-V games, however at

	src/sound/scsp.c
	src/sound/scsp.h
	src/sound/scsplfo.c
	src/drivers/stv.c

More ST-V Improvements, fixing various graphical issues (Shienryu Sprite Colours) and

	src/vidhrdw/stvvdp1.c
	src/vidhrdw/stvvdp2.c

Some Atari improvements with the new sets (old speed hacks removed that aren't really
needed anymore, both screens being displayed in Cyberball) [Aaron Giles]
	src/ -various, too many to list

Misc Changes [Nathan Woods]
	src/sndintrf.c:
	- Removed wave_sh_stop() call from the MESS specific WAVE sound
	interface (it is extraneous now)

	src/x86drc.c:
	src/x86drc.h:
	- Added a few macros for other miscellaneous X86 opcodes
	- Added a drc_dasm() call, a debug call that uses MAME's I386
	disassembler to disassemble DRC'd code
	(didn't compile, commented out until fixed)

	src/mame.h:
	src/windows/config.c:
	- Added 'GAMENOUN' and 'GAMESNOUN' macros; defined to be the
	human readable text for the words 'game' and 'games' respectively (this
	is so MESS can use the nouns 'system' and 'systems')

v60 Improvements (LDTASK, STTASK, ABSF and some missing \n.) [Olivier Galibert]
	src/cpu/v60/*

Added Sound and Improved Background emulation in HeliFire [Jarek Burczynski]

Misc Windows OSD updates and D3D fixes [Leon van Rooij]
	makefile:
	windows\windows.mak:
	 Added CFLAGSOSDEPEND variable. It is used when compiling osd code only
	(e.g. DirectX needs -Wno-strict-aliasing).
	 COMPILESYSTEM_CYGWIN determines if nasm or nasmw is used (the cygwin
	version of nasm is called nasm)

	windows\fileio.c:
	 Quick fix for some #defines in that don't work with win32api 2.4

	windows\snprintf.c:
	 Changed a variable name that conflicts with a gcc built-in

	windows\blit.c:
	windows\wind3d.c:
	 Fixed a bug that affected stv games when flipping/rotating the image

	windows\window.c:
	windows\window.h:
 	window size/prescale/rgb-auto effect can now change when the image size is
	changed by the game driver

SegaPCM fixes [Olivier Galibert]
	Fixes the pitch (the 15800Hz value was wrong, it should have been the
	main 4Mhz clock divived by 256) and also makes the code ultra-paranoid
	when it comes to out-of-range accesses in the sample roms.  Power
	Drift's sound code sometimes puts semirandom values for the first
	handful of keyons on song transitions.
	src/sound/segapcm.c

Added Proper Inits to term2la1 [Brian Troha]

Merged Zaxxon and Congo drivesr [CUrt Coder]
