	Added more data to Super Hang On Table

Increased the amount of adjustable memory banks from 24 to 32. [Nathan Woods]

ST-V Update [Angelo Salese]

	-Started to work with the A-Bus protection,it is a sort of data transfer with the
	 cartridge area,more info in the stv.c file.
	 Current implementation just fixes character selection screens in sss,I will work out
	 about this one in the future,it has various "interesting" issues which was thought
	 to be emulation probs(i.e booting in rsgun,textures in elandore etc.).
	
	-Added a preliminary timer 1 irq handling,it fixes pblbeach booting but it doesn't
	 work yet because of incomplete VDP-1 emulation.
	
	-Noticed that ignoring VDP-1 long word access read by SH-2 isn't correct and not
	 needed (because sss is protected rather than using an illegal procedure),it was
	 causing wrong graphics in fhboxers & boot errors in pblbeach,reversed it back to
	 default.

Added missing Player 2 controls to Space War (Leijac) [Steve Ellenoff]	

Pacman Driver Update [Dave Widel]
	Sets added:
	
	jumpshtp: prototype from PokeMAME
	vanvanb:  bootleg but it looks earlier.
	sprglobp: Not sure if this is the official set, or an accidental merged set with
	          the glob.
	ctrpllrp: I consider this sig. since it came in it's own cab, and they did change
	          some of the music.

	Other changes:
	
	Added full memory map, this should fix the ending of Ms Pac.
	Added a jumpshot dip.
	I didn't remove any sets, but I mentioned which of them are junk imo and why.

	* grouped the GAME() lines by hardware and then year.
	* moved jrpacmbl back into pengo.c

Emulated protection in Golden Axe ROTD [Charles MacDonald, David Haywood]

Fixed 65816 dasm error [Nathan Woods]

Minor Debugger Fix [Nathan Woods]
	Removed the VK_HOME and VK_END cases for the WM_KEYDOWN event.  As far as I can

	Shift+End are also handled correctly. 

Added standard set of Mahjong Inputs [Aaron Giles]

	- added support for TenPlay bios (from 10 games board)

	  but I have no idea how! I completed the game three times and it's not doing 
	  it anymore.

Tilemap Update [Aaron Giles]
	Added a user_data field for tilemaps. You can call tilemap_set_user_data() to
	set this field internally in the tilemaps. Before  rendering, this value will
	be copied into the (new) global  tile_info.user_data field, so that your
	tilemap callback can use it

Kaneko update in preparation for data from Blood Warriors [Sebastien Volpe]

Preliminary decryption of Shisensho II [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
	note: still being worked on

	computer out of src/machine/amiga.c into callbacks.  This allowed me to 
	get rid of all #ifdef MESS code out of src/machine/amiga.c

ST-V updates [Angelo Salese]
	-Fixed a bug with the VDP-1 ram reading,
	 SH-2 can do byte or word access, it's implicit that can't do long word access.
	 This fixes the Steep Slope Sliders booting so the game now works.
	-VDP-1 PTM's "draw by request" was actually causing sprites to flicker in
	 kiwames,reversed back to old implementation until I or somebody else understand
	 what the current issue is (clear_framebuffer?)
	-Finished the game header update,let me know if you like/don't like the system
	 used for the description of the games.
	-fixed a ST-V visible area incorrectness which was causing Virtual Mahjong 2 to
	 crash after the sound ram check
	-fixed a window effect bug in Double-density interlace mode,this fixes some
	 graphics in vmahjong & myfairld.
	-Guessed a bitmap positioning issue in double-density interlace mode,this fixes
	 the NBG1 positioning in myfairld.
	-My Fair Lady now works but only with sound disabled.I have not removed the
	 NOT_WORKING status due to that.

New Sound Functionality [Derrick Renaud]
	Took Frank Palazzolo's DISCRETE_FILTER2 code and made it work outside of the
	discrete system.
	See sound\filter.h for new functions.

Thanks to Pierpaolo Prazzoli (Reip) for putting together the 0.90 release while I was away

General Improvements
--------------------

FD1089 decryption [Nicola Salmoria, Charles MacDonald]
	- 100% accurate emulation of FD1089A, FD1089B should be considered 99% 
	because it will have to be verified with other CPUs (it is 100% for all 
	currently supported games).

	- complete tables provided by Charles MacDonald for 317-0018 (Action 
	Fighter), 317-0022 (Dunk Shot), 317-0168 (Aurail).

	- partial tables derived by comparison with the unencrypted versions for 
	Enduro Racer, Alex Kidd, 317-0024 (Time Scanner), 317-0033 (Alien Syndrome, 
	3 versions), 317-0027 (SDI). (actual working cpus are needed to obtain full
	tables)

Big Sega Update [Aaron Giles]
	* dunkshot graphics correct, controls hooked up
	* sdioj controls hooked up
	* timescna sprites fixed
	* shangona, shangnle now playable

	* all tilemap, sprite, and road code unified and moved into 
	  vidhrdw/segaic16.c
	* improved documentation on the various register layouts on the video side

	Note that in the process, I broke the title screen animation for Laser 
	Ghost, and there is now a 1-pixel column error on ddcrew's attract mode. 
	These are known issues that I will try to address soon.
