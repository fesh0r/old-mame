Sorry, this list of changes isn't complete due to hardware problems I'm having.

General Source Changes
----------------------

Many Improvements to the ST-V emulation, resulting in Hanagumi Columns being
playable and other games on the driver starting to show some
graphics [Angelo Salese, David Haywood]
	src/drivers/stv.c
	src/vidhrdw/stvvdp1.c
	src/vidhrdw/stvvdp2.c

Continued MegaPlay Improvements (still none fulyl working yet but more of the
bios menu tests pass now) [Barry Rodewald]
	src/drivers/segac2.c

Some System GX Improvements, mainly to the not yet working games [R.Belmont]
	src/drivers/konamigx.c
	src/vidhrdw/konamigx.c

Attempted to Improve Super Dodge Ball MCU Simulation [Acho A. Tang]
	src/drivers/sdodgeb.c
	src/vidhrdw/sdodgeb.c

Various Changes to keep the code inline with MESS [Nathan Woods]

Added 8 Player Support to the Core [Stefan Jokisch]

New games supported:
--------------------

Hanagumi Taisen Columns - Sakura Wars  [Angelo Salese, David Haywood]
	This the first st-v game to be supported by MAME, please note that due
	to the complexity of the system emulation is still preliminary and there
	are still various issues that will need ironing out, there is currently
	no sound.
	src/drivers/stv.c
	src/vidhrdw/stvvdp1.c
	src/vidhrdw/stvvdp2.c

Ultra X Weapons [Tomasz Slanina]
	some gfx offset problems / alignment (sprite handle can move?)
	src/drivers/ssv.c

Twin Eagle 2 [Tomasz Slanina]
	src/drivers/ssv.c
	Twin Eagle 2 DOES NOT WORK due to protection involving the directions
	in which objects travel, and as a side-effect collisions don't work
	correctly either, if somebody fixes this then itmight be fine apart
	from a few offset problems.

Super Trivia Master [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
	wrong colours
	src/drivers/strvmstr.c

Sprint 8 [Stefan Jokisch]
	src/drivers/sprint8.c
	src/vidhrdw/sprint8.c

New Clones supported:
--------------------

Lady Bug (bootleg on Galaxian Hardware) [Mike Coates]
	input ports incomplete
	src/drivers/galaxian.c
	src/includes/galaxian.h
	src/machine/scramble.c

Video Pool (Moon Cresta hardware) (bootleg of Video Hustler) [Mike Coates]
	dipswitches incomplete
	src/drivers/galaxian.c

0.72u2

General Source Changes
----------------------

Improved Megaplay a bit, the bios screens now show however the games still don't
work [Barry Rodewald]
	src/drivers/segac2.c
	src/includes/segac2.h
	src/vidhrdw/segac2.c

Various ST-V improvements, Hanagumi Columns shows a partial title screen (still
disabled so you'll have to enable it yourself if you want to see)
	[Angelo Salese]
	src/drivers/stv.c

Removed DCS Speed-Ups
	src/sndhrdw/dcs.c

Fixed a bug in the C 68000 core with the SBCD Opcode [Acho A/ Tang]
	States of the sign(N) and overflow(V) flags after SBCD,
	ABCD and NBCD operations are "undefined" according to Motorola.
	The C core randomizes the V flag and sets the N flag like signed
	operations.

	Viofight expects determinant results of the two flags from SBCD
	or it gets stuck in a math loop. The V flag now returns zero and
	the N flag mirrors carry exactly like what the ASM core does.
	src/cpu/m68000/m68k_in.c

Fixed Mustache Boy Continue Screen and attempted to improve speed [Tomasz Slanina]
	src/drivers/mustache.c

Misc Konami Fixes [Acho A. Tang]
	tmnt.c:
	- qgakumon resetting and screen darkening
	- tmnt2 load-save states(not good enough yet)
	- ssriders diagonal jittering(needs testing)

	konamiic.c:
	- boundary conditions and kludge removal in K007420

	rockrage.c:
	- rogue sprites

	kncljoe.c:
	- bad scrolling, clipping, rogue sprites

Couple of Improvements to the Fuuki games (Priority, BG Colours) [Paul Priest]
	src/drivers/fuukifg2.c
	src/vidhrdw/fuukifg2.c
	src/drivers/fuukifg3.c
	src/vidhrdw/fuukifg3.c

Guard against OP_ROM/OP_RAM overflows [Nathan Woods]
	This patch adds an optional facility to guard against OP_ROM/OP_RAM
	overflows.  This is implemented by adding new variables OP_MEM_MIN and
	OP_MEM_MAX that track the minimum and maximum address ranges for which
	using OP_ROM/OP_RAM is valid.

	Support for this feature is enabled via conditional compilation in
	memory.h.  There are three possible modes:

	CPUREADOP_SAFETY_NONE   - The status quo; no range checking at
	all
	CPUREADOP_SAFETY_PARTIAL  - Range checking only against the
	maximum address
	CPUREADOP_SAFETY_FULL     - Range checking against both the
	minimum and the maximum

	This patch has MAME using CPUREADOP_SAFETY_NONE, unless MAME_DEBUG is
	defined in which case CPUREADOP_SAFETY_FULL is set.  Thus as is, this
	patch should have zero effect on release versions of MAME.
	Additionally, being able to safely disassemble code near bank boundaries
	when using the MAME debugger is extremely useful.

	There is a slight performance hit when this is enabled.

Dipswitch Fixes:
	1st dipswitch of 3rd bank in 1941 [Fabrizio Pedrazzini]
	src/drivers/cps1.c

	Tetris Plus 2 (MS32 version) [Sonikos]
	src/drivers/ms32.c

	and a few others ...

Changed nkdodgeb to use proms from another Japan bootleg set, maybe this fixes
some problems with the colours.
	src/drivers/nkdodgeb.c

Included 8080 core updates from MESS
	src/cpu/i8085/*

Preliminary Hyperstone Core, not yet working well enough to run anything [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

	src/drivers/psikyosh.c

New Clones supported:

Hard Dunk (World)
	src/drivers/multi32.c

Super Bike (DK Conversion) [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

0.72u1

General Source Changes
----------------------

Changed Fuuki 16-bit driver to use Partial Updates for Raster Effects and enabled
them [David Haywood, Paul Priest]
	src/drivers/fuukifg2.c
	src/vidhrdw/fuukifg2.c

Temporary Fixes to a few of the System 16 driver problems (sound banking for
example)  Note, the driver is still being rewritten these are only minor 'fixes'
to improve things a bit until the rewrite is complete [Acho A. Tang]
	src/drivers/sysetm16.c
	src/vidhrdw/system16.c
	src/vidhrdw/sys16spr.c

Change so DIP menu isn't displayed if no Dipswitches are defined in the driver
instead of flashing a blank mneu when you try and enter it [Paul Priest]
	src/usrintrf.c

Various Changes [Nathan Woods]
	src/cpu/jaguar/jaguar.c:
	- Fixed a bug in the NORMI opcode

	src/cpu/mips/mips.c:
	- Removed use of the GCC specific varargs on macros feature

	src/sndhrdw/jaguar.c:
	- Changed around one of the #include paths (due to
	ProjectBuilder on Mac issues)

	src/sound/tms5220.c:
	src/sound/tms5220.h:
	- Added support for the TMS0285 variant (an old variant of the
	TMS5220)

	src/vidhrdw/jagblit.c:
	src/vidhrdw/jaguar.c:
	- Added support for the SRCSHADE and DSTA2 command bits to the
	Jaguar blitter.
	- Added some miscellaneous logging code
	- Changed around one of the #include paths (due to
	ProjectBuilder on Mac issues)

	src/vidhrdw/jagobj.c:
	- Added support for objects with pitch != 1 for objects with 1-2
	bits per pixels

	src/harddisk.c:
	src/harddisk.h:
	- Added a function to retrieve the interface

	src/ui_text.c:
	src/ui_text.h:
	- Added a MESS specific UI string (within #ifdef MESS of course)

	src/usrintrf.c:
	- Parameterized the setdipswitches() call; so that a menu that
	looks like the DIP switch menu can easily be made with different IPT_*
	values (MESS has a configuration menu that functions a lot like the DIP
	switch menu)

	src/artwork.c:
	- Small fix to allow the UI to be drawn if the artwork system is
	active but no artwork is present (not an issue for MAME)

	src/mamedbg.c:
	- Cleanup and fix of set_ea_info() so that negative offsets of 8
	or 16 bits do not have extraneous FF's in front of them.
	- More proper fix to the scanline display bug that prevented
	registers from being edited when the scanline display was on.

	src/cpu/hd6309/6309dasm.c:
	- Better message for when invalid opcodes are disassembled

	src/artwork.c
	src/artwork.h
	- Fixed crashing bug with clones

	src/inptport.c:
	- Adds some MESS specific IPT defaults (within #ifdef MESS)
	- Modified input_port_allocate() so that PORT_BITX declarations
	that specify JOYCODE_a_BUTTONb for their default codes will also get
	JOYCODE_MOUSE_a_BUTTONb or'd in.

	src/input.c:
	src/input.h:
	- Added seq_set_4() and seq_set_5()

	src/windows/video.c:
	- Changed render_frame() so that throttle_speed() will also be
	called when game_is_paused is set.  This prevents MAME from busy looping
	when paused.

Fixed Remaining Protection problems in TMNT2 and Sunset Riders, Fixed Combat School
Trackball sets from Crashing, Fixed Escape Kids Spries, Fixed Sticky Sprites in
Detana! Twinbee, Fixed Sprite Lag in some games [Acho A. Tang]
