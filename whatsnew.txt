Added correct sound ROMs to World Class Bowling Tournament and Deluxe.
[Brian Troha]

Replaced old Outrun bootleg with a new dump that passes the ROM test and has
proper ROM names. [David Haywood]

More PowerPC improvements: [Nathan Woods]
- Fixed exception handling; previously the MSR register was stored 
  in EDX, and EDX is not preserved across the call to ppc_set_msr()
- Implemented recompile_fcmpo()
- Fixed certain rules in rules.mak (some said drc_ops.h instead of 
  drc_ops.c)
- Commented the MSR_* values
- Moved BAT registers into their own structure
- Added DSI and ISI exceptions (non-DRC core only for now)
- Moved READ*/WRITE* functions into ppc_mem.c
- Changed memory handling so that reading and writing are done 
  through function pointers that can be changed at runtime (which would 
  be useful if, say a MMU was implemented in the future :-))

PSX/Namco System 12 improvements: [smf]

- reverse flag only has an effect on original GPU's.

Yet another fix to the PowerPC counters, reimplementing them from scratch.
[Ville Linde]

Some improvements to the Model 2 driver: [Ville Linde]
- Added the second SHARC

Fixed incorrect test in sauro.c video system. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Improved Lethal Enforces sprites, allowing 2 sprite chips to be created.
[David Haywood]

blending modes. Sprite shadows and several other effects are still not yet
implemented. And it's much slower than before. [Aaron Giles]

   the DRC core

   visible area in it.

[Corrado Tomaselli]

Fixed minor bug in TIA emulation, taken from the MESS code. [Wilbert Pol]

Renamed Hollywood Action to Action Hollywood. [David Haywood]

Major video update to Taito F3 driver that amongst other things properly 
implements zoom & column scroll according to how the hardware does it, 
which not only fixes glitches in various games but allowed many hacks to be
removed also.  Sprite & tilemap clipping is also implemented, as is
proper priority mixing and alpha-blending on the vram and pixel
layers. [Bryan McPhail]

Fixed exception handling and task switching in the V60 core. [Aaron Giles]

Add preliminary sound support for Action Hollywood. [Quench]

Improvements to the PSX CPU core [smf]

   (writing to file descriptor 1 or putchar will output to the console)
 - fixed disassembly of gte instructions.
 - fixed dismips.mak

Did another overhaul on the PPC603 counters (timebase should increment 
once every four core clock cycles and decrementer should decrement once 
every four bus cycles). [Ville Linde]

* Major update to Namco System 21 driver [Phil Stroffolino]

  - Starblade is working with emulated master/slave DSPs.  Graphic updates
  are a bit choppy; I believe there are 4 slaves and one master on the
  real PCB, with work distributed across the slaves.  Some background
  objects are still missing in Starblade - the giant "starships" in the
  background of the first stage, for example (sprites are present showing
  burning fires which are supposed to be superimposed on them).  The
  "direct drawing" feature is used during the high score presentation;
  colors are likely wrong, and there are missing graphics there as well
  (hexagons).

  - Solvalou works, but occasionally 3d graphics stop updating; press "A"
  to unblock the pipeline and resume drawing them.

  - The other System 21 titles are not working for various reasons. 
  Solvalou needed cuskey support (used from the master DSP).  Cybersled
  appears to use a different mechanism for uploading DSP code.

* Fixed road colors in the Suzuka games. [Phil Stroffolino]

* Added home/end key support in the history display. [Samuele Zannoli]

* Added debugger suppot for the decrementer register in the PowerPC
core. [Nathan Woods]

* Implemented column scroll in TC0100SCN chip; used on (at least)
Ninja Kids, Gun Frontier, Growl and Galemedes. [Bryan McPhail]

* Added ADSP-21062 core and partially hooked it up for the Model 2B
games. [Ville Linde]

* Additional progress on the PowerPC DRC (faster), support for
more exceptions, better support for the PPC internal serial ports.
[Ville Linde]

* Progress on the Konami PowerPC drivers [Ville Linde]
  - Cleaned up and consolidated common hardware
  - Hooked up ADSP-21062 and 3dfx chips
  - Initial reverse-engineering work on the KS001005
  custom 3D chipset in GTI Club
  - Initial NVRAM values plugged in for many games. 
  (They're used as a crude protection, similar to the
  EEPROM on GV System).
  - No games are playable or even show much yet, but
  nearly all of them do pass POST now.

* Fixed a minor bug in the SCSP timer handling. [Ville Linde]

* Fixed memory leak in the cpu subsystem. [Aaron Giles]
