Source Changes
--------------
Zeus updates: [Aaron Giles]
 * Figured out data format of 2 matrix form.
 * Extracted data for lights.
 * Added backface culling which mostly works but fails sometimes, so 
    it is disabled.
 * Started on some initial lighting calculations.
 * Cleaned up zeus wave RAM accessors.
 * Changed rendering code to allow for greater parallelism on multicore
    systems.
 * Removed some vestigial zeus 2 hacks.
 * Reduced visible area to remove artifacts.
 * Made right/bottom vertices inclusive to fix some gapping issues.
 * Fixed invasn lightgun offset.

Zeus 2 hardware:
 * Fixed ROM loading, added banking support.
 * Separated zeus 2 video implementation from zeus implementation.
 * Implemented direct pixel accesses; enough to get startup screens 
    to show.
 * Hooked up ZPRAM.
 * Fixed digital inputs for crusnexo.
 * Fixed default screen parameters to match the games.

Afega/nmk16 cleanups: [David Haywood, Tomasz Slanina]
 * Merged afega.c and nmk16.c drivers
 * Removed many hacks from both.
 * Fixed a number of games

Fixed C219 sample read order and implemented sign+magnitude format.
Removed GAME_IMPERFECT_SOUND flag from all Namco NA-1 games.
[Philip Bennett]

Fixed ROM-based DCS2 system to ignore HLE transfers. (Fixes broken 
sound in invasn.) Properly reduced internal memory on the ADSP-2104 
variants. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug that would cause events to leak through to the game when the 
debugger was up. [Aaron Giles]

Verified some cpu clocks of original boards using a frequency counter:
[Corrado Tomaselli]
 * Changed Success Joe Ym2203 clock from 3mhz to 4mhz
 * Changed Pang M6295 clock from 990khz to 1Mhz
 * Changed Halley Comet main cpu clock to 1.664mhz (it's not a 
    mistake, the clock is very low)
 * Besides confirming clocks on some games, I modified:
 * Aerofighters and Turbo Force sound z80 to 5mhz
 * Midnight Resitance 68k cpu to 10mhz (20mhz crystal) and modified 
    m6295 clock to 1mhz. Also confirmed pin 7 is high.
    (Midnight resistance has a lot of slow downs on the pcb too)

Minor "code quality" improvements: [Atari Ace]
 * fixed some remaining static/const qualifier missed cases
 * fixed some missing #include "foo.h"
 * a few global names were modified to make them less generic/more 
    consistent (voodoo.c, vrender0.c, lethal.c, rungun.c, zac2650.c)
 * some dead/useless code was removed (i8051.c,model1.c,romcmp.c)
