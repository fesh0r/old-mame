Wired up save state support for all the games in pacman.c, jrpacman.c, and
pengo.c. Marked all games as GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE. [Aaron Giles]

Added new generic macros to state.h to make it simpler to do save states.
Use state_save_register_global(var) to register a driver-related global
variable. Use state_save_register_item(module, instance, var) to register
other variables with specific module and instance names. Converted the MCR
and Cinematronics vector saves over to this. As a result, save states for
games will be incompatible with prior versions of MAME. [Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the 8255 PPI, 7474 TTL, and the TMS5110 sound 
chip. Added save state support to the galaxian.c driver and all the 
associated drivers. Marked all games in galaxian.c, scramble.c, scobra.c,
frogger.c, and amidar.c as GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the timing of save state bank registration so that dynamically
installed banks will work properly. [Aaron Giles]

Added validity check to ensure driver names are 8 characters or less.

More NSS updates. This is mostly for MESS's benefit but nss_ncaa improves 
from it too. [R. Belmont]
 * SPC700: Fixed operand order for SBC to memory
 * SNESHW: Implemented unknown DMA & HDMA modes
 * SNESHW: Fixed SRAM sizing (used as protection in some games)
 * SNESHW: Boosted interleave
 * Fixed scroll registers to work like real hardware
 * Fixed timing of OAM address reset and range/time over reset to better 
    match real hardware
 * Fixed missing "break" for HDMA mode 5
 * Fixed behavior of OLDJOYx registers when auto-read is enabled

Added filters back into the Scramble driver. [Hans Andersson]

Changed break/watchpoints in the new debugger to display in hex.
[Anonymous]

Updated usrintrf.c to work better with MESS. [Nathan Woods]

Merged ctribe machine driver with ddragon3. [Mamesick]

Improved Zip & Zap DIP switches. [Brian Troha]

Improved Egg Hunt DIP switches. [Brian Troha]

Fixed flipscreen in TC0100, which improves Liquid Kids. [Bryan McPhail]

Improved Metal Saver DIP switches. [Brian Troha]

Cleaned up merging of Jolly Card sets. [Roberta Fresca]

Updated 65816 and 37710 cores: [R. Belmont]
 * Fixed both CPUs to set the data bank register to the destination on 
    an MVN/MVP
 * Some minor tweeks so the debugger works properly when the 65816 is 
    executing out of a read handler (as it always is for the SNES)

Filled in missing asteroids DIP switches. [Kevin Jonas]

Updates to the I386 core: [Ville Linde]
 * Added i486, Pentium and Cyrix MediaGX CPUs
 * Replaced the opcode tables with a dynamically built one
 * Rewrote the cycle counting to support different CPUs
 * Added page translation
 * Tons of bugfixes
Also updated the SPI driver to work with these changes.

Cleaned up the taito_f2 driver: [Brian Troha]
 * Converted what I could to port_include and port_modify
 * Fixed a few rom names and standardized names add a PCB layout.
 * Changed the sound CPU to 240000/6 and the YM2610 to 240000/3 as there 
    is no 16MHz OSC on the PCB.  Only a 26.686 & 24.000 MHz chips.

Fixed inputs in vliner: [Mamesick]

Added some basic zooming support to the gstriker/twcup94 driver.
[David Haywood]

Improved accuracy of joystick types reported in -listxml. [Buddabing]

Added "Uptime" to the bookkeeping info displayed in the UI. [Aaron Giles]

Added new driver flag: GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE, to indicate drivers which have
save state support that is supposed to work. Attempting to save state on
a game without this flag will give a warning. Save state-related bugs may be 
filed against drivers with this flag set. [Aaron Giles]

Removed the GAMEX and GAMEBX macros. The flags parameter has been moved into
the GAME and GAMEB macros and these are used for all games. [Aaron Giles]

Converted a few more drivers over to using the new memory_configure_bank
calls. [Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the Cinematronics vector sound hardware and to
the Z80 CTC system. Also fixed QB3 banking when used with save states.
Marked all the games in cinemat.c with GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE.
[Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the TMS5220 chip. Added missing registers to
the 6800 core's save state. Cleaned up 6821 PIA initialization and save
state registration. Marked all the games in mcr.c with GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed ui_popup to display longer by default for longer messages.
[Aaron Giles]

Added new option -autosave which automatically loads a game at startup and
saves it at exit time for any game which is explicitly marked with
GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE. For other games, this option has no effect. [Aaron Giles]

More Sega C2/Genesis-based games cleanup: [Aaron Giles]
 * fixed crashes introduced in last version
 * centralized interrupt generation for all Genesis-based games
 * implemented protection correctly for Puyo Puyo 2

Changed validity checks to use hashes for speed. Also changed them to only
run on the drivers in the source file of the current game, rather than on all
games, in non-debug builds. And fixed the coinage sorting check so that it
doesn't depend on the linker to order the strings in a particular way.
[Paul Priest]

Removed -skip_validitychecks option now that the time to execute the checks
is not as bad. [Aaron Giles]

Improved speed in Top Gunner by pre-decoding the vector processor microcode.
Also added a shift register to produce the LCD-like look of the score and
other numbers. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Nintendo Super System sound update: [R. Belmont]
 * Fixed bugs in SPC700 ADC, SBC, ADDW, SUBW, MUL, DIV, & CLRV opcodes
 * Fixed several APU hardware/timer issues
 * Added accurate sound DSP emulation from the latest OpenSPC
 * Fixed some timing issues that prevented ActRaiser from syncing up
Result: generally accurate sound in the working NSS games, and in many 
SNES games over in MESS as well.

Added missing vertical movement to Gatsbee. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed error message when auditing optional files. [smf]

Bumped interleave in the elecyoyo driver to avoid attract mode hang. [MASH]

driver. [Roberto Fresca]

Small NSS update: [R. Belmont]
 * Fixed disassembly of 2 SPC700 instructions
 * Fixed behavior of the APU port clear flag to not clobber the output 
    ports - games now can boot and run without the "APU skipper"
 * Fixed SPC700 CMP instruction flags

Some under-the-hood debugger changes: [Olivier Galibert]
 * Added an osd-private void * to debug_views
 * Made view sizing more dynamic
