Sega Updates
- decrypted and added aurailj. the program roms are bad however so it doesn't work
- the Altered Beast sets were a mess. Some of them were using the wrong  version of

  and/or harddisks attached to the emulated SCSI bus and specify what each one's SCSI ID
  is.

Changes from Aaron Giles

segaxbd.c:
* fixed missing sound in rachero/abcop
* used explicit sync to get rid of high interleave on loffire
* marked 317-0136.key bad until Nicola fixes it

    - divide by zero just returns the divisor (needs to be verified)
    - mode 1 divides are unsigned
    - divides are only triggered by a write with A4 set

to the V-unit games (d'oh!)

realbrk.c
* Fixed Pachinko Gindama Shoubu sets (Normal and DX) and added specific controls to them.

  probably it's just missing nvram emulation;
* Reorganized a bit the memory map in the driver;

2413intf
* Added two new functions for the YM2413 sound chip,
  YM2413_register_port_0_msb_w() and YM2413_data_port_0_msb_w(),they are used by pkgnsh.

jalmah.c
* Improved the MCU protection code for Mahjong Daireikai & fixed various ROM loading issues
  now more graphics are correctly displayed.
