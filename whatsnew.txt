  Salese]

- bzone.c: Add the Address Decode prom to Red Baron. Currently not used
  in emulation but we archive it anyways. [The Dumping Union]

- Improved clocks in bankp.c and gyruss.c [Corrado Tomaselli]

- Enable proper save stating for bfm_bd1 machine which should fix MT
  bug#03990 as well.  [James Wallace]

- naomi: Make illvelo boot, probably others too [O. Galibert]

- model2.c: Updated several sets with Sega's game and / or ROM board
  ID#. Corrected the sound CPU & sample roms for the Manx TT set (as
