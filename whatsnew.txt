Source Changes
--------------
Added information to the 1943 driver (video) about priorities encoded
in PROM. [robiza]

Minor optimization to the DISCRETE_INPUT modules. The node output is 
now calculated when a discrete_sound_w() is called instead of each 
step in the simulation. Also removed the Enable line from the 
DISCRETE_ADJUSTMENT modules. They should never be disabled.
[Derrick Renaud]

Removed per-frame metadata support from chdman. Creating an A/V now
simply requires an AVI file input. [Aaron Giles]

Changed laserdisc support to parse white flags and other data from 
the VBI data directly, rather than relying on the textual metadata. 
Expanded video frame cache to 3. Changed the way frames are assembled 
to decrease the likelihood of getting an interlaced weave. Fixed sound 
creation so that it is done at reset time instead of device start, 
when the sound devices aren't yet live. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug in winwork that caused the creation of single work items to 
return NULL, and thus lead to massive memory leaks when using A/V 
CHDs. [Aaron Giles]

Added new functions cputag_set_input_line() to assert input lines
via CPU tag instead of index. [Aaron Giles]

Disks opened by the romload module are no longer identified by index.
Instead, they are identified by the region they were loaded in. This
generally means one disk per region. get_disk_handle() now takes a
region name in place of an index. Updated all callers to do this.
The SCSI modules in particular posed a challenge to make this work,
so watch out for potential bugs there. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the IDE interfaces to default to choosing the region with the
same tag as the device for its master disk (assuming no slave). Added
support for specifying explicit master/slave disk regions as part of
the configuration, though slave disks are still not supported yet.
[Aaron Giles]

Change the laserdisc interface to no longer require a disk number or
a custom sound device. Both are now assumed to be tagged the same as
the laserdisc device. Updated all drivers accordingly. [Aaron Giles]

Merged memory maps for drivers: blmbycar, blockade, blockhl, blockout, 
bombjack, boogwing, and bottom9. [Andrew Gardner]

Added readmes for Galaga, The Outfoxies, Splatter House, Top Racer,
Kyros No Yakata, Bombs Away, Meikyuu Hunter G, Crazy Kong, Moero Pro 
Yakyuu Homerun Kyousou, Lucky & Wild, Match It, Country Club, 
Enforce, Elevator Action, Chuka Taisen, The New Zealand Story, 
Buck Rogers Zoom 909, Head On, Victorious Nine, Youma Ninpou Chou, 
Pairs, Woodpecker, Slap Fight, Alcon, Tiger Heli, Superman, 
WWF Superstars, Area 51, Animalandia Jr, Avengers In Galactic Storm, 
Alien 3: The Gun, Aquajack, and Missile Command. [Guru]

Fix region jumper on psikyo4 (loderndf). [David Haywood]

Backported a bunch of FM OPN (YM2608/2612) fixes from Genesis Plus 
GX.  All of this was verified on real hardware.  
[Eke-Eke, Nemesis, Alone Coder, AamirM]
 - implemented PG overflow, aka "detune bug" (Ariel, Comix Zone, 
    Shaq Fu, Spiderman...)
 - fixed SSG-EG support
 - modified EG rates and frequency
 - fixed EG attenuation level on KEY ON (Ecco 2 splash sound)
 - fixed LFO phase update for CH3 special mode (Warlock, Alladin)

Scanline exact rendering for dkong & clones [couriersud]
 * Sprite limit of 16 sprites per scanline implemented from 
    schematics.
 * Proper wrap around from bottom to top
 * Added some notes about sprite limits and hardware to dkong 
    driver (thanks to R. Belmont)

Added edge connector pinout info to flower.c. [Brian Troha]

Some initial work on the adp driver. [robiza]

Fixed window in shanghai and shangha2. [robiza]

8257dma and z80dma devices now require device callback handlers 
instead of machine handlers. Updated affected drivers accordingly.
[couriersud]

Improved Dsp56k CPU interrupt handling. Polygonet Commanders now 
advances past its first dsp handshake. [Andrew Gardner]

Added proper laserdisc support for MACH 3, Us vs. Them, and Cobra
Commander (MACH 3 hardware). Old laserdisc hacks are now removed.
The code now talks to the standard Pioneer PR-8210 interface. Also
removed hacky "target list" from the MACH 3 ROMs; this information
is now decoded on the fly from the right channel laserdisc audio.
[Aaron Giles]
 
Other Gottlieb cleanups: [Aaron Giles]
 - fixed rev 2 sound again
 - fleshed out memory maps and behaviors according to the schematics
 - hooked up coin counters.
 - moved sound inputs to audio/gottlieb and included them in
    all relevant drivers
 - ordered input ports and ROM definitions consistently
 
Other laserdisc changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - changed PR-8210 interface to work consistently for both Gottlieb
    and Stern games
 - added audio callback mechanism to allow drivers to peek at the
    raw audio streams

Set the initial 8253 timer output to 2 to indicate that it is 
undetermined. [Wilbert Pol]

Removed obsolete makemeta tool. Replaced it with new ldverify
tool which walks through either an AVI or CHD capture from a
laserdisc and ensures that there are no anomalies lurking in
the VBI data. [Aaron Giles]

Added new option to chdman, where if you use -createav with
a special filename (either 2:2 or 3:2) it will create a fake
laserdisc files with the equivalent cadence. This can be used
for testing until full captures are available. Most games used
2:2 apart from Dragon's Lair and Space Ace, which were 3:2.
Note that even though these files are essentially blank, they 
are Huffman-compressed, meaning that the maximum compression
ratio you will get is 8:1, so they still end up ~5GB. [Aaron Giles]

Moved error strings from chdman.c to chd.c, where they can be
fetched from any caller via the new chd_error_string()
function. [Aaron Giles]

Updated vbiparse to improve Manchester code decoding. It now
assigns a confidence level per bit based on how solid the
data is. Also added a new function vbi_parse_all which parses
the white flag and all three lines of metadata from a 
laserdisc frame. It then compares line 17 and 18 against each
other and selects the most likely candidate based on per-bit
confidence and other factors. [Aaron Giles]

Added frame number display to laserdsc.c. It is off by
default, though most players can be configured to turn it on
(not sure if any actually do). It can be manually toggled via
the backslash key during playback. [Aaron Giles]

Discrete sound core optimizations: [couriersud]
 * moved a couple of exp(x) from _step into _reset where appropriate
 * use tabulated function values for the transfer function in 
    DSS_INVERTER_OSC

Forced synchronization (stream_update()) before the YM2151 status is 
actually read. [Jarek Burczynski]

Added Discrete Sound to Fantasy, Nibbler and Pioneer Balloon.
[Derrick Renaud]

Fixed I/O watchpoints. [Aaron Giles]

Changes to the cheat.xml format: [Aaron Giles]
 - new tag <comment> (within <cheat>) is read and preserved 
    when saved
 - removed variable attribute from <parameter>; it is now 
    assumed to be 'param'
 - added default attribute for <parameter>

Added new variable 'frame' accessible from cheat scripts. This
can be used in the conditional to prevent execution on every
frame, or for other effects (like displaying temporary messages).
[Aaron Giles]

Added new variable 'argindex' which is the index when processing
an <argument> with a count attribute greater than 1. [Aaron Giles]

Reinstated the cheat menu. It now displays all loaded cheats and
allows for them to be activated. All known cheat behaviors should
be working now. Cheats are toggled on/off with the left/right
arrow keys. Oneshot cheats are activated by hitting enter. Pressing
enter on other cheats resets them to their default values.
[Aaron Giles]

Continued the cleanup of inputs in drivers starting with C (the 
remaining ones), D and E. Improvements include conditional dips 
added to dynduke and diplocations for chinagat, chqflag, circus, 
citycon, cloak, contra and dynduke. [Fabio Priuli]

Added tags to EVERY input port in drivers starting with F->Z.
[Fabio Priuli]

Removed PORT_START macro. Renamed old PORT_START_TAG to PORT_START.
All input ports must have tags. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for DEL as well as BS for backspacing in the game
select menu. Also limited input to ASCII characters. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed Rim Rockin' Basketball to use the HD6309 core. [Tim Lindner]

Added diplocations to bigrun, scudhamm, cischeat & f1gpstar.
Removed the current hacky handling of f1gpstar coinage dips to use
conditional ports instead. In order to do this, the possible
conditions were extended to support less than/greater than 
comparisons. [Fabio Priuli]

Fixed bug that would break conditions on ports using the
PORT_DIPUNKNOWN_DIPLOC macro. [Aaron Giles]

Added diplocations to the following drivers: combatsc.c, copsnrob.c, 
cosmic.c, crgolf.c, crimfght.c, crospang.c (here I also added service 
dips to heuksun and bestri, which allowed me to verify locations), 
crshrace.c, dambustr.c, darkseal.c, dassault.c, dblewing.c, 
ddrible.c, deadang.c. Also added locations to the following games: 
ddragon & ddragon2 on ddragon.c and docastle, dorunrun & dowild in 
docastle.c. [Fabio Priuli]

Verified CPU clocks for athena. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Added module profiling to discrete sound core [couriersud]
 * added DISCRETE_PROFILING macro to discrete.h
 * Upon discrete_stop, the worst performing modules will be listed

Verified and corrected CPS1 refresh rate. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Changed sound cpu clock of Spinal Breakers to 5Mhz as verified on the
pcb. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Corrected MPU4 AY8910 output weightings. [James Wallace]

Added word alternates for operators in expressions: [Aaron Giles]
  +   plus
  -   minus
  *   times or mul
  /   div
  %   mod
  !   not
  ~   bnot
  &&  and
  &   band
  ||  or
  |   bor
  ^   bxor
  lt  <
  le  <=
  gt  >
  ge  >=
  eq  ==
  ne  !=

Changed cheat escaping to automatically escape && & < and <=
to and band lt and le. [Aaron Giles]

Decrypted Da Ban Cheng (dbc set in igs_blit.c) [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Removed bad dumps from ad2083. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed bug in aviio.c which could cause an infinite loop if attempting
to read sound beyond the end of the file. [Aaron Giles]

Added expression validation callback to verify names for CPUs and
memory regions. Extended error codes to report incorrect memory 
spaces, memory names, or memory sizes. Added verification callback
to the debugger to validate CPU and memory region names, as well
as verifying that a requested address space exists for a given
CPU. [Aaron Giles]

Restored previous behavior that allowed popmessage() messages to
overlay menus and other UI. [Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------
More documentation on the Kiki KaiKai MCU. [Guru, Brian Troha]

A bit more cleanup in the gottlieb driver, still incomplete.
[Aaron Giles]

Verified Free Kick PROMs and improved documentation. [Brian Troha]

Added the ability to pass an optional destructor to 
ui_menu_alloc_state(). [Nathan Woods]

Updated to build with the latest DirectX SDK, which doesn't support 
Direct 3D 8 & Direct Input 7. By default, the makefile is set up to
compile the old way, but you can set DIRECT3D=9 and DIRECTINPUT=8 in
windows.mak or on the command-line to build with a more modern SDK.
[smf, RansAckeR, uRebelScum]

Irem m63 - adjusted AY frequencies to proper 1.5 MHz [Stefan Lindberg]

DSP56156 CPU Core updates [Andrew Gardner]
 - Rewrote core logic, communications, and interfaces.
 - Added three parallel memory moves to the disassembler.
 - Initial interrupt logic in place.

Plygonet.c updates [Andrew Gardner]
 - All communication hacks have been removed.
 - Memory maps have been temporarily reverted while new DSP56k cpu 
    core catches up.

Merged memory maps for beezer.c, bishi.c, and bladestl.c. 
[Andrew Gardner]

AICA updates [Deunan Knute, ajax16384, R. Belmont]
 - Fixed ADPCM decoder to remove bad optimization and match YMZ280B. 
    DC offset is fixed and output quality is higher
 - Improved handling of slot monitor and timers B and C
 - Simplified interpolation code

SH2DRC: Add PC-relative load optimization and ability to disable if 
necessary [R. Belmont, based on an idea by Mariusz Wojcieszek]

Changed the way memory regions are referenced. Instead of a single
integer value, regions are now referred to by a region tag. The
region tag must be unique among all regions defined for a given
game. This change required updating all the ROM region definitions 
in the project to specify the tag instead of region number.
[Aaron Giles]

Updated the core memory_region_* functions to accept a tag instead 
of an integer. Added new memory_region_next() function to allow for 
iteration over all memory regions. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the auto-binding behavior of CPU regions. Previously, the
first CPU would auto-bind to REGION_CPU1 (that is, any ROM references
would automatically assume that they lived in the corresponding
region). Now, each CPU automatically binds to the region with the 
same tag as the CPU itself. This behavior required ensuring that
all previous REGION_CPU* regions were changed to regions with the
same tag as the CPU. [Aaron Giles]

Introduced a new auto-binding mechanism for sound cores. This works
similarly to the CPU binding. Each sound core that requires a memory
region now auto-binds to the region with the same tag as the sound 
core. In almost all cases, this allowed for the removal of the 
explicit region item in the sound configuration, which in turn 
allowed for many sound configurations to removed altogether.
[Aaron Giles]

Updated the expression engine's memory reference behavior. A recent
update expanded the scope of memory references to allow for referencing
data in non-active CPU spaces, in memory regions, and in EEPROMs.
However, this previous update required an index, which is no longer
appropriate for regions and will become increasingly less appropriate
for CPUs over time. Instead, a new syntax is supported, of the form:
"[tag.][space]size@addr", where 'tag' is an optional tag for the CPU
or memory region you wish to access, followed by a period as a 
separator; 'space' is the memory address space or memory class you
wish to access (p/d/i for program/data/I/O spaces; o for opcode space;
r for direct RAM; m for memory regions; e for EEPROMs); and 'size' is 
the usual b/w/d/q for byte/word/dword/qword. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up ROM definition flags and removed some ugly hacks that had
existed previously. Expanded to support up to 256 BIOSes. Updated
ROM_COPY to support specifying a tag for the source region. Also 
updated the address map AM_REGION macro to support specifying a
tag for the region. [Aaron Giles]

Updated debugger windows to display the CPU and region tags where
appropriate. [Aaron Giles]

Updated -listxml to output region class and tag for each ROM entry.
[Aaron Giles]

Changes to lucky74.c driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Pre-defined CPU and SND clocks.
 - Switched the color system to RESNET calculations.
 - Completed the remaining DIP switches.
 - Added lamps support. Created a layout to show them.
 - Changes on the interrupt system (need to be verified on the PCB).
 - Renamed the graphics regions to more descriptive names.
 - Corrected the manufacturer's name.
 - Splitted the driver to driver + video.
 - Updated technical notes.

Changed unmapped read for mspacman to see if it changes tunnel 
behavior. [David Haywood, as suggested by dwidel]

SH2DRC: add SUBV, replace ADDV with C version as a precaution. (Fixes 
most of Mantis #2026, except the part which is a separate bug). Added
new implementation which uses flags directly, keeping the C versions
in reserve in case they are needed. [R. Belmont, Aaron Giles]

Added more validation to the address map detokenization, in order to
catch cases where multiple read/write handlers are assigned to a range.
Fixed cases in the code that failed these checks. [Atari Ace]

i8051 cpu core timer updates: [Wilbert Pol]
 - Added support for timer mode 0 (13 bit timer)
 - Cleaned up timer code a bit, fixing some off-by-one errors when 
    timers overflow.

Naomi updates [Samuele Zannoli]
 1) refactors many global and static variables in video\dc.c into a
     structure to hold the tile accelerator state
 2) textures should be better decoded with more pixel formats
 3) adds placeholders for some register probably used by the dimm board
 4) corrects a little error in a rom board register (very important, 
     now at least the gdrom games try to start)

Added region and regionbytes fields to the deviceconfig, which are
auto-filled by the device manager before starting the device. This
simplifies the auto-binding process for devices. Added new selector 
for device-specific ROM regions. Not yet wired up in the ROM loader.
[Aaron Giles]

Simplified SH2 DRC shift/rotate instruction implementations.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed menu handling so it doesn't swallow the tab key. [Aaron Giles]

Changed symbol table reference parameters to void * from UINT32.
[Aaron Giles]

Enable strict PC relative loads for ST-V games; at least Cotton 
Boomerang needs them. [R. Belmont]

Added new option 'cheatpath' to specify one or more paths for cheat
files. Removed old option 'cheat_file'. [Aaron Giles]

Updated xmlfile.c to specify the line number for each node, for more
accurate error reporting. [Aaron Giles]

Removed old cheat.c/.h and replaced them with code that will read and
write the new XML-based cheat format using the new cheatpath option
(cheats still need to be enabled in order to load at all). Note that
the cheats are not implemented yet, but they are fully parsed. To test
saving, whenever a cheat file is successfully loaded, it is immediately
written back out as 'output.xml' to the cheat directory for validation.
[Aaron Giles]

Minor cleanups: [Oliver Stoenberg]
 - removed of unprintable chars (newlines) in SH-2 disassembler
 - removed a few unnecessary checks after malloc_ort_die() calls
 - changed two romload.c warnings to use GAMENOUN instead
 - added "deprecat.h" in a  few src/mame/drivers files
 - cleaned up the mame.mak by adding all missing defines and grouping 
    them based on cpu.mak
 - renamed video_exit() to winvideo_exit() for consistency in function 
    names

Changed commented-out functions to #ifdefs. [Atari Ace]

Source Changes
--------------
Robustified key behavior when the debugger is visible. Should now
properly ignore the "break into debugger" keypress and not allow
related characters to filter through. Removed some hacks related to
making that work in the past. [Aaron Giles]

Changed osd_wait_for_debugger() to take a machine parameter and a
"firsttime" parameter, which is set to 1 the first time the function
is called after a break. The Windows debugger uses this to ensure
that the debugger has focus when you break into it. [Aaron Giles]

Changed short names for STV BIOS back to single words. [Brian Troha]

Added information on how to toggle the built-in speedup in Ms Pacman 
or the fast shot in Galaga in 20pacgal. [Brian Troha]

Removed MDRV_SOUND_ADD. Renamed MDRV_SOUND_ADD_TAG to MDRV_SOUND_ADD. 
All sound chips must now include a tag. Changed all existing drivers 
to define a unique tag for each sound chip. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed incorrect i960 behavior when generating interrupts. [ElSemi]

Changed -listxml to now output the tag names for CPUs and sound chips.
[Aaron Giles]

Added validity checks to ensure no duplicate sound or CPU tags.
Fixed several duplicates. [Aaron Giles]

Changed MDRV_CPU_ADD to require a tag. Removed MDRV_CPU_ADD_TAG.
Tagged all CPUs. [Aaron Giles]

TGP / Model 2 fixes [ElSemi]
 - TGP now correctly uses table roms (model1/2 updated accordingly)
 - removed FIFO hack on srallyc (game now runs)
 - added analog ports reading for model 2A/B/C
 - fixed some loading instructions in the TGP. that fixes srallyc 
    automatic transmission bug

Merged CPU0 and 1 memory maps in flower, improved interrupt generation
[David Haywood]

Dsp56156 Disassembler rewrite. [Andrew Gardner]
 - Rearranged decoding behavior.
 - Updated code style to MAME standards.
 - Tested each single-word opcode with custom ROMs.

Laserdiscs are now devices. Updated all drivers accordingly.
[Aaron Giles]

Merged memory maps in battlnts, bbusters, bigevglf, bigstrkb, and
bionicc. [Aaron Giles]

Added new functions attotime_to_ticks() and ticks_to_attotime() to
convert between attotimes and a clock tick at an integral frequency.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed the 6532 RIOT device into a proper device. Rewrote the
logic to be simpler and leverage the new attotime functions. Changed
the I/O port setters to specify a mask, and changed the I/O port
callbacks to pass in the previous value. Updated tourtabl and
gameplan drivers to use the new device interface. [Aaron Giles]

Converted audio/starwars.c, audio/exidy.c, and audio/gottlieb.c to 
use the new RIOT implementation instead of rolling their own.
[Aaron Giles]

Began gottlieb.c cleanup. Converted palette calculations to resistor
weights. Corrected video timing. Reduced the number of separate
machine drivers. Fixed incorrect spriteram sizes. Populated full
memory maps for the main CPU and the rev 1 sound board. More to
come. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed 8257 DMA terminal count stop for autoload mode and added 
callback function existance check. [Miodrag Milanovic]

Completed removal of all explicit calls to input_port_read_indexed().
[Fabio Priuli]

Converted tinklpit keycus implementation from a table to a LFSR.
[Olivier Galibert]

Removed unnecessary ROM shuffling code in namconb2. [Olivier Galibert]

Made the initialization of various Konami PPC drivers consistent 
from run to run, hopefully fixing most multisession issues. Also moved
some allocations from static to dynamic storage. [Atari Ace]

Made input_port_read_indexed() private to machine/generic.c. 
Eventually it will probably disappear altogether. Fixed the two 
remaining instances. [Aaron Giles]

Converted a number of drivers from A-C to using tagged input ports,
and AM_PORT_READ in the address maps. [Fabio Priuli]

Added DIP locations to a large number of drivers: bwidow.c, bzone.c,
bestleag, blackt96, bogeyman, bombjack, boogwing, bottom9, brkthru, 
darwin, buggychl, squaitsa, btime, bnj, lnc, zoar, disco, cabal, 
canyon, cbuster, cclimber, swimmer and guzzler. [Fabio Priuli]

Made DIP switch renderings consistent regardless of UI aspect.
[Aaron Giles]

Moved more items out of .data by either applying const, removing the 
non-zero initializer (if its overwritten by init/reset) or by adding 
appropriate initialization code. [Atari Ace]

Removed conditional logging code in favor of allowing the compiler to
optimize it out. This prevents bitrot of #ifdef'ed code. [Atari Ace]

Source Changes
--------------
makemeta changes: [Aaron Giles]
 * Split out Manchester code parsing into a separate utility module.
 * Rewrote Manchester code parsing to be clock based.
 * Updated makemeta to call the new functions.
 * Changed makemeta to parse a different format for metadata.
 * Fixed Huffyuv decompression in aviio.
 * Added more robust logic to parse out the white flag.

Newest Japanese Naomi BIOS added [batman2509, starke/peap]

pit8253 updates: [Wilbert Pol]
 - Changed the implementation to use timers internally.
 - Removed the frequency change callbacks.

slapfght driver update: [stephh]
 * Renamed sets :
    - tigerh2  -> tigerhb1 ("Japan set 2"   -> "bootleg set 1")
    - tigerhb1 -> tigerhb3 ("bootleg set 1" -> "bootleg set 3")
    - gtstarba -> gtstarb1 ("bootleg set 2" -> "bootleg set 1")
    - getstarb -> gtstarb2 ("bootleg set 1  -> "bootleg set 2")
 * "Performan" :
    - cleaned/fixed Dip Switches and added port locations
 * "Tiger Heli" :
    - added MCU simulation for 'tigerhb1' (in fact, I only had to 
       return the correct value for the hardware test as there 
       doesn't seem to be any other communication - I'm still not 
       convinced that this bootleg had a MCU)
    - cleaned/fixed Dip Switches and added port locations
    - added notes with the differences between the different sets
 * "Get Star" / "Guardian" :
    - added MCU simulation for 'getstar' and 'getstarj' heavily based 
       on 'gtstarb1' bootleg
    - cleaned/fixed Dip Switches and added port locations
    - added notes with the differences between the different sets 
       (and especially detailed the numerous ingame bugs in 
       'gtstarb2')

Added new module uiinput.c which manages input for the user interface.
The OSD is responsible for pushing mouse events and character events
to this interface in order to support mouse movement and text-based
input (currently only used for the select game menu). Added support
for navigating through the menus using the mouse. 
[Nathan Woods, Aaron Giles]

Redesigned the UI menus so that they can maintain a richer state. Now
the menus can be generated once and reused, rather than requiring 
them to be regenerated on each frame. All menus also share a comment 
eventing system and navigation through them is managed centrally. 
Rewrote all the menus to use the new system, apart from the cheat 
menus, which are now disabled. Reorganized the video menu to make it 
easier to understand. [Aaron Giles]

Converted UI startup screens to use astrings. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed edge case in the DRC front-end that would incorrectly tag the
end of a sequence as "return to start" even if the last instruction
did not abet the starting instruction. [Aaron Giles]

Replaced the crazy number of get/set functions for render containers 
with a single get/set of a user settings struct. [Aaron Giles]

merged exctsccr.c into champbas.c. [Nicola Salmoria]

UDRC-based SH-2 dynamic recompiler: [R. Belmont]
 - All games on all drivers should work as before except "colmns97" 
    and "stress" which crash due to sound system trouble.
- All idle skips are still included. They are quite a bit less 
   effective than they were on the interpreter, but they still give a 
   boost.
- Fast RAM bypass is not included yet so this does not represent 
   final performance. That said, it's consistently faster than the 
   interpreter even now. Example: sfiii3 on 0.126 gets 609% on the 
   interpreter and 961% on the DRC.

Added ST-V BIOS info based on text at 0x800 (byte swapped). 
Reorganized the BIOS list & description. Added the USA bios to 
smleague and it's a USA only cart. [Brian Troha]

Added save state suport to Konami CPU & Aliens. [Nicola Salmoria]

Moved kodb to fcrash.c (which will probably end up being the home of 
the cps1 bootlegs). [David Haywood]

SH-4 update [Samuele Zannoli]
 - Fixed TRAPA and some versions of FMOV
 - Improved disassembly for MOV.W, MOVA, MOV.L, FIPR, and FSCA.

Fixed memory leak in romcmp. [Nicola Salmoria]

Merged memory maps in the cabal driver. [Nicola Salmoria]

i960: respect the rounding mode for CVTRI [ElSemi]

Corrected g13knd wave ROM 0 offset. [Philip Bennett]

Fixed cocktail sprite position in galaxian.c. Fixes that the frog 
disappears for player 2 if moved backwards. [couriersud]

Changed direct access EEPROM interface to return the "bus width" of 
the EEPROM data, and the size is in terms of units, not bytes. 
Updated all drivers accordingly. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the ROM loading code to actually alter the region flags based
on the CPU endianness and bus width when creating the region, rather
than fixing them up on the fly. This means that callers to
memory_region_flags() will get the correct results. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the expression engine to use two callbacks for read/write 
rather than relying on externally defined functions. [Aaron Giles]

Expanded memory access support in the expression engine. Memory 
accesses can now be specified as [space][num]<size>@<address>. 
'space' can be one of the following:

   p = program address space of CPU #num (default)
   d = data address space of CPU #num
   i = I/O address space of CPU #num
   o = opcode address space of CPU #num (R/W access to decrypted opcodes)
   r = direct RAM space of CPU #num (always allows writes, even for ROM)
   e = EEPROM index #num
   c = direct REGION_CPU#num access
   u = direct REGION_USER#num access
   g = direct REGION_GFX#num access
   s = direct REGION_SOUND#num access

The 'num' field is optional for p/d/i/o/r, where is defaults to the
current CPU, and for e, where it defaults to EEPROM #0. 'num' is 
required for all region-related prefixes. Some examples:

   w@curpc = word at 'curpc' in the active CPU's program address space
   dd@0    = dword at 0x0 in the active CPU's data address space
   r2b@100 = byte at 0x100 from a RAM region in CPU #2's program space
   ew@7f   = word from EEPROM address 0x7f
   u2q@40  = qword from REGION_USER2, offset 0x40
   
The 'size' field is always required, and can be b/w/d/q for byte, word,
dword, and qword accesses. [Aaron Giles]

Added World Rally support to tiny.mak/.c. [Macareno]

changela input improvements: [RansAckeR]
 - DIP switch fixes
 - Added DIP locations.

Minor srmp5 update: [Sonikos]
 - Removed hack in drive machine R3000
 - Adjusted  R3000 frequency to 25 Mhz according to speglsht 
    (the hardware is the same)
 - Adjusted visible area (but i'm not sure it's correct)
 - Fix one rom loading

Changed partial refresh policy in snk68.c and updated comments.
[Nicola Salmoria]

More conversion to input_port_read(): [Fabio Priuli]
 * converted to use tagged inputs and handlers all drivers starting 
    with S & T
 * simplified input reads in system24 (removing a redundant handler)
 * cleaned up a bit inputs in system 16 & 18 bootlegs (among the 
    other things, now coinage and P2 inputs in fpointbl & fpointbj 
    work again)
 * removed a lot of redundant #define from taito drivers, replacing 
    them with PORT_INCLUDEs and definitions from taitoipt.h
