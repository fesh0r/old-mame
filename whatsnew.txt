MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
01691: [Misc.] Various Sets: when exiting a game, seems to be 
  any game I get an eip error (Aaron Giles)
01697: [Graphics] sfa3, sfa3b, sfa3u, sfa3ur1: About the blue 
  background in startup screen. (Nicola Salmoria)
00206: [Graphics] ninjakd2: PCB info for Nicolas state. 
  (Nicola Salmoria)
01695: [DIP/Input] ptblank, gunbulet: Crosshair doesn't move (smf)
01694: [Graphics] punisher, punishrj, punishru: missing graphic 
  (Nicola Salmoria)



Source Changes
--------------
PSX core updates: [smf]
 - removed casts and removed unnecessary decoding from NCLIP.
 - added signed values to PAIR & PAIR64.
 - renamed PAIR64.lw to PAIR64.q
 - tidied up DPCS, improved flag calculation and added support for 
    lm/sf fields.
 - added sf/lm support to INTPL, improved flag calculation & 
    calculates correct rgb 
 - fixed calculation of bit 31 of GTE FLAG register, when writing 
    to it directly.
 - added lm mode to OP and fixed the calculation.
 - added lm mode to SQR.

Seibu implementation cleanups: [David Haywood]
 - added cop/heatbrl ram clear stuff
 - tried to make cop a bit more generic, breaks a few things for 
    now, but better than duplicated code all over the place
 - added the sound cpu to raiden2, although it doesn't make any sounds

Fixed CPS1 palette control register to match tests on msword psb. 
[Nicola Salmoria, Corrado Tomaselli]

Changed the pic8259 implementation into a device. [Wilbert Pol]

Fixed an opcode in quizf1. Fixed encrypted disassembly for 
bp+ix+offset8 and bp+it+offset8. [Robiza]

Modified bionicc to compute the palette based on the schematics.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Verified several CPS1 graphics ROM mappings against PAL dumps. 
[Nicola Salmoria]

Changed device read/write functions to take a const device_config *.
Reverted recent hacks to get around this and removed unnecessary 
casts. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed I8039 DAA instruction when A is > 0xF9. [Wilbert Pol]

Fixed crosshair update when the game is not polling the coordinates.
[smf]

Merged CPS1, CPS2 memory maps and some tweaks from schematics, though 
to get perfect memory maps dumps of the A-board PALs would be needed.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Adjusted docastle refresh rate to match PCB measurement. 
[Nicola Salmoria]

Finished memory map merge for W drivers. [Andrew Gardner]

Added support for using smaller-sized memory handlers directly in
memory maps. To do so, you need to use the new AM_READn/AM_WRITEn
macros and specify a mask for which bits are connected. [Aaron Giles]

Removed word-sized handlers from 6821pia.c. Updated drivers that
needed them to use these new interfaces instead. [Aaron Giles]

Updated gaelco3d.c and itech8.c to remove the need for memconv.h
by using this new feature. [Aaron Giles]

Added machine parameter and macros for the CDP1802 callback functions.
This seems to have fixed the player sprite flashing in Destroyer/
Altair/Draco. [Curt Coder]

Fixed lookup table for sprites in spikes91. [Robiza]

Made some changes to the 'v25' code in toaplan2.c. Batsugun does 
upload what looks to be the entire program, unencrypted. If enabled 
it runs to the point of waiting for interrupts, however, for those it 
looks like it needs a real V25 core with register banks etc.
[David Haywood]

Converted the IDE controller to a device. Updated all drivers
accordingly. [Aaron Giles]

Added new functions for dynamically installing device memory 
read/write handlers. [Aaron Giles]

Updated install_memory_XXX_handler() functions to take a machine
parameter. Updated all drivers accordingly. [Aaron Giles]

Merged installation of read and write handlers where appropriate.
[Aaron Giles]

Simplified memory.c code for dynamic installation so that a single
function handles all the work; a NULL read or write handler 
indicates not to install anything for reads or writes. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed sprite overdraw mode to match Mutant Night movie. 
[Nicola Salmoria]

Properly marked puzznici as a bootleg and disabled the MCU simulation 
on it, it has it's own internally. [David Haywood]

Merged memory maps for aquarium, argus, armedf, bagman, battlera
drivers. [Aaron Giles]

Created new macro: AM_RAM_WRITE(handler) which specifies a memory
range to be RAM-like for reads but calls the given handler for writes.
[Aaron Giles]

Replaced AM_READWRITE(SMH_RAM, handler) with AM_RAM_WRITE(handler).
Also replaced AM_RAM AM_WRITE(handler) with AM_RAM_WRITE(handler).
[Aaron Giles]

Added correct rom dump for Shinobi4 set. [Arzeno Fabrice]

Added good denjinmk graphic rom. [Guru]

Removed ancient 720 kludge in the T-11 core. [Aaron Giles]

Added support in the T-11 core for an external vector via irq_callback.
Apparently the hardware actually did support this and it is necessary
for emulating the BK 0010/11 computer in MESS. [Aaron Giles]



New games added or promoted from NOT_WORKING status

MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
01571: [DIP/Input] stadhero: Player 1 and Player2 Start are mapped 
       twice. (stephh)
01673: [Graphics] sfjp: Game backgrounds replaced with other images
       (Fabio Priuli)
01567: [DIP/Input] megazona, megazonb, megazonc, megazone, megaznik: 
       P2 button 1 key mapped twice and P2 button 2 missing (stephh)
00458: [Misc.] NEC CPU debug bug (robiza)
00029: [Sound] contcirc: Audio emits from one speaker on start up. 
       (Nicola Salmoria)
01609: [DIP/Input] Various - tested srmp4 (ssv.c), ttmahjng 
       (route16.c), vsmahjng (vsnes.c), tokkae (konamigx.c), sf2 
       (cps1.c): INP playback loses sync quickly (Aaron Giles)
01680: [Graphics] area88, unsquad: [possible] DOT TEST in service mode
       shows garbage chars (Nicola Salmoria)
00761: [Speed] finalapr: Heavy performance hit. (couriersud)
00352: [DIP/Input] spaceskr: The cabinet DIP setting is inverted, when 
       you set it upright mode, control is separated for P1 and P2, 
       the scre (Nicola Salmoria)
01659: [Core] stereo balancing is wrong (Aaron Giles)
01622: [Core] -refreshspeed has no effect (Aaron Giles)
01663: [DIP/Input] Hat switches not working (couriersud)
00250: [Graphics] 3wonders: Various graphic glitches. (Nicola Salmoria)
00405: [Graphics] cawing: Text in the attract mode is garbled. 
       (Nicola Salmoria)
01021: [Side-by-side] dorunru2: Side-by-side test. (Nicola Salmoria)
00404: [Graphics] 3wonders: a glitch when u insert your record name 
       when game is over. (Nicola Salmoria)
01552: [Graphics] 3wonders, 3wonderu: Another little graphic glitch 
       on attract mode (Nicola Salmoria)
01081: (partial): megaplay.c (all games): 1 Player Start and 2 
       Players Start are duplicated. (couriersud)


Source Changes
--------------
Changed the system to show a message if coin-lockout is active and 
a coin key is pressed. [couriersud]

Actually fixed -refreshspeed. [Aaron Giles]

Reverted previous SCSI CD change which broke some games. [R. Belmont]

Seibu COP cleanup, primarily sorting the code and identifying 
similarities in different implementations. [David Haywood]

Fixed an erroneous debug change which leaked into the last version of
the namcona1 update. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed marineb colors. [David Haywood, Tomasz Slanina]

Rewrote INP recording from scratch, since all old INPs are broken 
anyways. Header now includes timestamp, which overrides the default 
time base for MAME's system time. Each frame recorded now gets a 
timestamp. Analog ports are recorded once per frame and interpolated.
Analog port calculations are all done in fixed point for consistent 
results. A bunch of other minor tweaks in the input port code. 
NOTE: There may still be a few changes to the final INP format.
[Aaron Giles]

Improved graphic decoding for Legionnaire, the BK3 tiles are now 
correctly extracted from the TXT region, map screen has correct 
tiles now. [David Haywood]

Removed CPS1 tile kludges and replaced with per-game ROM mapping 
tables. Ideally, the ROM mapping should be derived from mapping of 
the PALs found on the B board. Note that this is a significant change 
and some new bugs might be caused by it. Unlike previous bugs, 
where extra garbage tiles would appear in the games, the new bugs 
would be tiles or sprites MISSING--so they will be harder to notice. 
This would happen because in some cases the 16x16 regions of the gfx 
ROMs can be used by both scroll2 and sprites, while in other cases 
they must be separated. [Nicola Salmoria]

PSX updates: [smf]
 - Fixed the SR masks for MTC0.
 - Added ability to test the instruction/data cache ram. The 
    scratchpad and BIU register are now handled internally to the CPU.
 - All writes are performed with masks. SWL/SWR used to be implemented 
    with two writes ( one byte and one word ) when writing three bytes,
    now it only ever performs one. Byte and Word writes use masks as 
    they leave the rest of the register on the bus, which can be 
    picked up by larger registers.
 - The read/write functions to use are cached when the SR bits are 
    updated, as are the bad address masks.
 - Added coprocessor 1 & 3 support, though they don't do anything 
    useful.
 - All loads now go through the delay pipeline, a lwl/lwr will grab 
    the value out of the pipeline if it's updating the same register.
 - Added undocumented behaviour of BLEZ/BGTZ. The comparison for zero 
    can be changed by specifying an alternate register in the RT field 
    ( the documentation says you should always use register 0 ).
 - Restricted to 16 COP0 registers & generate an exception if any of 
    the 5 for the MMU are used.
 - Added BCF/BCT instructions, although I have found no conditions 
    that affect them yet.
 - Generates an exception if any MMU instructions are executed.
 - Sets the CE instruction for all exceptions, not just those 
    involving a coprocessor. The bits of the opcode that specify the 
    coprocessor are grabbed no matter what the instruction.
 - Added TAR register and BT bit in SR. When an exception occurs 
    during a branch, BT determines whether it was taken or not. The 
    TAR register gets set to the destination of the branch.
 - Fixed the BD bit when you are in a branch delay slot and you didn't 
    take the branch, this shows up in the pipeline as !pc.
 - Fixed branches within a branch delay slot.
 - Multiply & divide instructions can be aborted if you write to 
    HI/LO before reading the result. Added data breakpoints, you 
    don't appear to be able to set breakpoints on any of the 
    addresses internal to the CPU.
 - Multiply/divide/GTE instructions can execute when an exception is 
    taken, although the EPC indicates that it hasn't. The BIOS avoids 
    rerunning GTE instructions as they are destructive, so you have to 
    make sure they run.
 - Added bus error handling, PSXCPU is limited to 8mb of ram & any 
    access outside this range will trigger an exception. I believe 
    this is to be an internal limit.
 - Added CXD8611R as a specific CPU type, System 12 appears to allow 
    more than 8mb of ram & it's possible that this is different.
 - Mapped out all instructions to either generate an exception or 
    ignore bits.
 - Updated the disassembler to match the decoding.
 - Fixed disassembling of branch instructions in a branch delay slot.
 - Lui checks for a ori/addiu following and will show you the result.
 - Added step over/out support.
 - Fixed standalone disassembler.
 - Fixed SZ0 truncation.
 - Fixed IRGB truncation and conversion to IR1/IR2/IR3
 - Added IR1/IR2/IR3 saturation when calculating ORGB.
 - Fixed OTZ sign extension
 - Fixed reading from SXYP
 - Fixed reading from IRGB
 - Fixed writing to LZCR
 - Fixed sign extension of GTE control registers
 - Fixed writing to FLAG
 - Fixed flag calculation in F macro.
 - Fixed avsz3 & avsz4 flag & otz calculation.

Fixed unicode crashing bug with input names. [Aaron Giles]

Renamed input port functions: [Aaron Giles]
  readinputport           -> input_port_read_indexed
  readinputportbytag      -> input_port_read
  readinputportbytag_safe -> input_port_read_safe
Added machine parameter to input port functions. Updated
many drivers to accomplish this.

Bulk converted drivers explicitly calling input_port_n_r() with a 
bogus offset to calling input_port_read_indexed() instead.
[Aaron Giles]

Memory map merges for drivers starting with U, V, W, and Z.
[Andrew Gardner]

Mostly fixed sound in N64-based games. [Adam Gashlin]

Correct DMA functionality in N64-based games. [Ville Linde]

Aerfboot improvements: [robiza]
 - sprite offset are now correct
 - split spriteram in two parts
 - identified last sprite for the two parts
 - promoted to "working" (no sound)
 
Pallavol improvements: [robiza]
 - fix for sprite's y-coordinate
 - implement lookup table for convert sprite code in the real code
 - change the name to "1991 Spikes (Italian bootleg)
 - fix scroll
 - fix offset

Merged sonson memory maps. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added mising TC0060DCA sound mixer to the Taito Z driver. Marked one 
dblaxle ROM as BAD_DUMP. [Nicola Salmoria]

Changed the 8237dma implementation into a device. [Wilbert Pol]

Fixed wrong tile-sprite priority in m62 driver. [robiza]

Fixed nec v30 dasm when a "real-time encrypted cpu" is used. Also
fixed Execution Clocks for add,addc,and,or,xor,cmp,sub,subc 
instructions. [robiza]

Removed the hardcoded dependency on a 8254 device from the 8042kbdc 
code. Changed the drivers using the 8042kdbc to define their own 
8042kdbc - 8254 dependency. [Wilbert Pol]

Rewrote core memory handlers as inline functions. These should be 
easier to trace through in a debug build, yet should operate the same 
as before. [Aaron Giles]

Created a complete set of functions for all databus sizes (8,16,32,64) 
and all endiannesses. A few functions are redundant, but it is now 
very clear which functions to use in which scenarios. It is also now 
possible to rely on being able to access values of 8, 16, 32 or 64 
bits via the built-in accessors without fear of crashing. 
[Aaron Giles]

Updated all cores using 8-bit handlers to explicitly call the 8-bit 
handlers with the appropriate endianness. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed a few games which were calling n-bit handlers directly to use 
the generic forms. In the future, this is all the access drivers will 
have. [Aaron Giles]

More opcodes fixed in gussun oyoyo and risky challenge. [robiza]

Added tags and locations to dips for marvins.c and matmania.c.
[Fabio Priuli]

Enabled roz tilemap in emeraldia, but it's not centered in the right 
position when it's not in its original dimension. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed 'lghost*' Dip Switches. [stephh]

Reduced the number of save state callback types from 3 to 1. The
only remaining form is the one that takes a pointer parameter. Added 
macros for STATE_PRESAVE and STATE_POSTLOAD to define common 
functions. Added machine parameter to these functions. Updated all 
drivers and CPU/sound cores  to use the new macros and consolidate 
on the single function type. As a result pushed the machine parameter 
through a few initialization stacks. [Aaron Giles]

Removed unnecessary postload callbacks which only marked all tiles
dirty, since this is done automatically by the tilemap engine.
[Aaron Giles]

Updates for the driver wc90b.c: [ClawGrip]
 - Removed the second YM2203, it isn't present on the bootleg boards
 - Changed the clocks according to the oscilators found on the board

Added the running_machine* parameter to the function passed into 
cpunum_set_irq_callback() and adds the IRQ_CALLBACK macro for 
the callback function. [Oliver Stoenberg]

Cleaned up the Machine usage in the osd/windows files and added the 
running_machine parameter where possible. [Oliver Stoenberg]

Various tweaks/fixes from MAMEPlus:
 * save state support for FD1094 chips
 * improved graphics in athena
 * improved sound balance in armedf
 * derived refresh rate for toaplan1 games
 * improved sound balance in tmnt games
 * derived clocks for suprridr
 * tweaked xmen visible area
 * derived clocks and refresh rate in twin16 driver
 
CPS1: Verified some gfx ROM mapping tables against PAL dumps. Improved 
understanding and emulation of palette related registers. 
[Nicola Salmoria, Corrado Tomaselli]

Source Changes
--------------
Renamed galaxian.c -> galaxold.c. Updated all drivers accordingly.
[Aaron Giles]

Cidelsa driver updates: [Curt Coder]
 - de-deprecated the timer callbacks
 - moved PCB RAM to the heap and fixed index overflow
 - converted CDP1869 to the new device system
 - refactored to represent how the hardware actually works
 - added PMA latching on OUT5
 - separated Cidelsa video to its own file

COP CPU updates: [Curt Coder]
 - implemented interrupt
 - implemented serial input/output
 - fixed XAD/LDD, XIS1, RMB3 opcodes
 - fixed clock divider
 - fixed internal memory map size
 - added some cpu variants
 - fixed serial timer
 - fixed clocks
 - fixed COP410 RMB3, XAD instructions
 - general cleanup

Fix cfg file corruption if joystick is not connected; itemclass now 
part of token if item is not found. Settings for joysticks which use 
a custom item id will still be lost. A fallback has to be provided 
here since those will use a token generated from the input item name.
[couriersud]

Memory system changes: [smf]
 * Now passing mem_mask to the read and write debug hooks. This 
    allows the address & size of the memory access to be correctly 
    calculated when using a memory call that takes a mem_mask.
 * New macros added for checking mem_mask. ACCESSING_BITS_m_n, 
    These check for any access within the bounds between bit 'm' and bit
    'n' (counting bit 0 as the least significant bit). Currently the 
    pattern for checking whether both bytes of a word is written is to 
    make two byte checks.
 * All occurrences of ACCESSING_LSB, ACCESSING_MSB, ACCESSING_LSB16, 
    ACCESSING_MSB16, ACCESSING_LSB32, ACCESSING_MSB32, 
    ACCESSING_LSW32, ACCESSING_MSW32 & simple mem_mask checks have 
    been replaced with the new macros.

Added fatal error if AM_READ_PORT() references a non-existent port.
[Aaron Giles]

Converted special-case DIP switches (service, unknown, unused) into 
their own token type rather than expanding into other tokens. The 
reduces the number of redundant strings and data. [Aaron Giles]

Galaxian rewrite. Ultimately will combine the existing drivers
for galaxian, scramble, frogger, scobra, amidar, and dambustr.
For the moment, only a subset of games are implemented in the
new system; the remainder are running on the old code. Main features 
are accurate video timing, correct stars implementation, better 
organization, simplified input ports, and many other smaller fixes.
[Aaron Giles, stephh]

Minor cleanup and simplification in the video and palette code. 
Removed palette_config(). [Aaron Giles]

Fixed interrupt handling and 16-bit memory accessors in 6840ptm.c.
Also cleaned up code for the sake of readability. [Philip Bennett]

Added multiplier (same as wecleman) to Flak Attack. Info provided by 
VU801qCf. [Yasuhiro Ogawa]

Namco NA1 improvement: [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
 * Fixed sprites shadow in namcona1 driver and removed Emeraldia hack.
 * Added tilemaps and sprites 4bpp mode
 * Added preliminary ROZ implementation (disabled until the enable / 
    disable register is found)
 * Changed background pen to fix emeralda demo

Discrete sound system improvements: [couriersud]
 * Added DISCRETE_RCFILTER_SW to discrete sound. This implements 
    multiple RC networks with CD4066 switches to connect/disconnect 
    capacitor.
 * Implemented discrete mixing in circusc using DISCRETE_RCFILTER_SW
    and sound routing to route 76416 output to discrete logic. 
 * Added discrete filtering and mixing to galaxian.c games using 
    konami_sound.
 * Fixed timing of stream_update in discrete_sound_w. All sound 
    cores update before processing changed data.
 * Added streeam_update to discrete_sound_r
 * Now supports multiple output nodes per module. 
    In this case, NODE_XXX is the default output. Alternative outputs 
    may be accessed by using NODE_XXX_YY where 00<Y<08.
  
    You may also access nodes with macros:
  
      NODE_XXX = NODE_SUB(XXX, 0)
      NODE_XXX = NODE(XXX)
      NODE_XXX_YY = NODE_SUB(XXX, YY) with YY != 00 
      
    This should e.g. make discrete sound emulation easier when dealing 
    with e.g. flip flops (Q & QQ) and binary counters.
 * Added sanity checks to check consistency issues introduced by this 
    change
 * Modules specify number of outputs ==> Certain special modules 
    (WAVELOG) may no longer be used as input nodes
 * Removed explicit (NODE_XX + expr) from a couple of drivers

Fixed encoding/decoding of negative denormal floats in the AICA/SCSP
DSP. Shouldn't actually affect any games. [kingshriek, Deunan Knute]

Changed Seibu sound CPU to use AM_READ_PORT("COIN") instead of 
input_port_0_r. [stephh]

bloodbro.c driver improvements to DIP locations and coin modes.
Added notes for 'bloodbra'. [RansAckeR, stephh]

Add input ITEM_IDs for additional axes and switches. Also added 
ITEM_IDs for up to 4 hats/POVs. [couriersud]

Merged memory maps for half of the W drivers. Also made a couple of 
random touchups for X, Y, and Z drivers. [Andrew Gardner]

Added a little magic to make the Atomiswave BIOS try to be more 
verbose, but our video emulation isn't good enough to cooperate.
[R. Belmont, ElSemi]

Added bootleg of badlands - heavily modified, not working.
[David Haywood]

Fixed DS2401 state loading now that the digital i/o board's serial 
number has been changed to a const by not saving it. As the serial 
number cannot be changed at run time it was rather pointless. [smf]

BFCobra improvements: [Anonymous]
 * Added plane priority to blitter, fixing Treble Top signature 
    writing
 * Video output now supports all modes - lores, hires, mixedres, 
    8/7/4/3 bits/pixel, fixing Every Second Counts colour problems
 * Added line draw, fixing missing stuff from Question Of Sport
 * Change blitter loop type control - there are 4 types of loop.
 * Corrected video frame rate to 50Hz.
 * Corrected Z80 speed to 5.91mhz
 * Accounted for Z80 cycles stolen during a blit operation. Improves 
    gfx/sound sync and seems to fix the final round lockup in Every 
    Second Counts.

Various SCSI devices register state items by their disk ID, which are 
not unique across device types. Introduced a device-type offset for 
CD-ROMs so their registrations don't clash with harddisks. 
[R. Belmont]

Fixed tilemap viewer to draw the whole tilemap when categories are 
used. Added new option TILEMAP_DRAW_ALL_CATEGORIES to do this
efficiently. Updated several drivers to use this instead of rendering
each category independently where appropriate. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added DIP locations to blueprnt.c [RansAckeR]

Fixed ledutil.c so it compiles cleanly under MSVC. [Mike Haaland]

Astrocade update: [Dirk Best]
 - Update src/mame/includes/astrocde.h to use an XTAL value
 - Clear interrupts if they are no longer valid
 - Add the knob inputs

Added new makefile flag VERBOSE which enables gcc's verbose output
during compile. [Marc Sandusky]

Corrected clocks on Rygar. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Changed "Machine" to "machine" in a number of places when the 
running machine parameter is already available. In some cases this
also allowed for the removal of deprecat.h. [Oliver Stoenberg]

Did some major cleanup and gutting of pcshare.c. [Wilbert Pol]

Created a built-in overlay for Armor Attack using just rectangles.
[Mr. Do!]

Added dynamic control of RX and TX pins to 6850 ACIA emulation - this 
is needed for correct operation of the MPU4 Video communications 
system, and may be handy for some MESS systems. To use, set the rx 
and tx clocks to 0 in the acia interface, then use acia_tx_clock_in() 
and acia_rx_clock_in() respectively. [James Wallace]

Added proper implentation of hardware collision in mermaid. This 
fixes mermaid (when the player is in the water with the sharks) and 
rougien. Also fixed priorities in mermaid and rougien and a sprite 
wrapping bug. [Robiza]

Fixed CPS1 background color. This fixes 3 wonder (game start) and 
mtwins (explosion during attract). It seems to break Varth, however, 
and has dubious effects on the boot sscreens of avsp, sfa3 and 
possibly other CPS2 games. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added discrete filtering and mixing to ironhors. One driver less 
using FILTER_RC. [couriersud]

Fixes for aerfboot (bootleg of aerofgt): [Robiza]
 - fixes spriteram3 (previous value was too high and in the "city" 
    level some build disappear
 - sprite gfx bank (previously some sprite appear right and some 
    sprite was wrong)
 - fixed perfectly the sprite zoom
 - removed multisprite support; in the bootleg aren't present

Converted the pit8253 implementation into a device. To make it  
easier to use I've also created a src/emu/devconv.h in the same style
as src/emu/memconv.h. [Wilbert Pol]

Replaced anonymous timer in tx1 with an allocated one to make state
saving closer to reality. [Hugh Allen]

Changed winwork.c from using hand-built scalable locks to using
standard Windows CriticalSections for now, to hopefully address
