0.70

This contains all the updates listed which were part of the source only diffs listed below
(0.69a, 0.69b, 0.69u3) plus a few extra bits and pieces.  A couple of drivers still appear to
be broken with the new timer system (deadang, artmagic for example) but hopefully most of the
problems were ironed out.

0.69u3 (0.69 Update 3)

source diff, changed numbering system to ux instead of a,b,c because people were getting
confused and thinking mame069b.zip (mame 0.69 _b_inary) was the updated version when it
wasn't.

misc fixes and improvements this time, no changes related to the timer system so as far
as testing that goes this isn't an essential upgrade.

if you use this code in your own build of Mame please make sure you use the correct
version number to reflect the inclusion of this updated code.

0.69a (0.69 Update 1)

This version is provided as a source diff only, more releases like this may follow
depending on how this one goes down, the intention is to allow people to have the
latest code without the hassle and bandwidth requirements of a new binary.

If you can't compile this then don't worry, normal releases will still happen, this
doesn't change anything as normal release plans are concerned, please don't hassle
whoever maintains your favourite port of Mame to add the updates here, not everybody
is going to have time to make new binaries on a regular basis.

A number of Changes to the Timer System [Aaron Giles]

	All the CPU scheduling has moved into cpuexec.c and been taken out of
	timer.c. A number of bugs relating to time tracking for suspended CPUs have
	been fixed.

	A side effect of all this is a change in the behavior of the CPU scheduling.
	For the most part, games are fine with this. However, there were a few
	exceptions:

	* taitosj.c: timing of the MCU communication broke
	* arkanoid.c: timing of the MCU communication broke
	* harddriv.c: stunrun timing glitches, racedriv/steeltal/hdrivair broken
	
	(There may be more, but I haven't found them yet.)

	The first two problems have been fixed, as has racedriv, but steeltal,
	hdrivair, and stunrun still have issues.
	
	Oh, one other useful function I added is this:

	   cpu_boost_interleave(double timeslice_duration, double boost_duration);

	You call this if you need to temporarily crank up the interleave for a short
	period of time in order to get CPU synchronization working. I used this in
	arkanoid and taitosj to get the MCU communications working. For example, you
	could say:

	   cpu_boost_interleave(TIME_IN_USEC(1), TIME_IN_USEC(100));

	which would interleave the CPUs on 1 usec boundaries for the next 100 usecs.
	Even more useful is this:

	   cpu_boost_interleave(0, TIME_IN_USEC(10));

	A very small value (0) for the first parameter means "use perfect
	synchronization", which should guarantee cycle-accurate synchronization for
	the specified duration. Note that this is *really* slow, so you don't want
	to be doing it too much!

	Let us know ASAP if anything else is broken as a result of this update
