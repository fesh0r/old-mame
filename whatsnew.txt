Added 4 different crosshair styles to differentiate different players'
crosshairs. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote vidhrdw/wecleman.c to make the code more readable. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed game reset in galaxian due to running out of timers. [Aaron Giles]

Added thrash protection emulation to the NVRAM in coolpool.c. [Aaron Giles]

Improved Windows-specific memory debugging to track file/line numbers for
allocations. This required a couple of changes to the core makefile.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed remaining memory leaks in the new debugger code, and one in the
artwork system. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up several video drivers that were using non-auto memory allocation
functions for bitmaps and memory. [Aaron Giles]

System 18 games. [Aaron Giles]

combinations against an osd_die() call. [Firewave]

Added logerror and memdump commands to the new debugger. [Nathan Woods]

In the PowerPC core, implemented the SMI input line, and added a placeholder 
for the TLBISYNC input line (doesn't do anything yet). Also implemented the 
TBU special variable on the 603. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed Wizz Quiz clone. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added shadow effects to the SSV driver. [Luca Elia]

Simplified additive path in slapstic code. This should not impact any games
that use it, but it is worth verifying. [Aaron Giles]

Improvements to The Couples driver: Improved the video hardware, added a 
preliminary PPI8255 + inputs interface, added a better workaround of the 
$b011 jump, and added sound. Now the game is somewhat playable, but there 
are still some problems in the game. [Angelo Salese]

Fixed DIP switches in several games:
* Dream Soccer '94
* Major Title
* Seibu Cup Soccer
* Caveman Ninja (World & US)
* Spinal Breakers
* Play Girl 2
* Rohga
* Shootout
[Brian Troha]

Added 'find' command to the new debugger for performing memory searches.
[Aaron Giles]

but still not working. [Tomasz Slanina]

Fixed TMS34010 reverse blitters so they didn't perform extraneous source
memory fetches. [Aaron Giles]

Old debugger no longer forces the memory display to 16-bit words regardless 
of the size specified with the M command. [Andrew Church]

Fixed OKI sample rate in Dark Seal/Crude Buster. Attempted to fix Vapor Trail
dropped sound commands. [Bryan McPhail]

Changed trace and traceover commands so they can append to existing files by
placing '>>' before the filename. [Nathan Woods]

Source Changes
--------------
Added the ability to specify internal read/write handlers for CPUs so
that the new debugger can view internal RAM. Hooked this up for the
TMS32025 core. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed window mode 1 in the TMS34010 core, as well as bugs that prevented
misaligned stack accesses from working and a bug that didn't force the
PC to be 16-bit aligned. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug in MAC instructions in the TMS32025 core. Also fixed cycle
counting 
problems that led to inaccurate internal timers. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed end-of-sprite list and flip screen in Hollywood Action.
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed colors in New Sinbad 7. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Several Taito SJ sprite fixes:
- Fixed sprite priorites. This fixes several priority issues in Tin Star,
  Elevator Action, High Way Race, and the car wrapping around in Elevator
  Action at the end of a level.
- Added sprite clipping at the sides of the screen. This was verified to
  happen on the real board, and it affects bullets wrapping around in 
  Elevator Action. I'm only 99% sure that the clipping is correct this 
  way :)
- Fixed sprite hardware collision detection. This fixes the last round in
  Pirate Pete, bonuses in Alpine Ski, end of level 1 in Water Ski.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed DIP switches in Rohga. [Yasuhiro Ogawa]

Several Volfied fixes:
- Fixed visible area.
- Fixed rom names.
- Improved c-chip simulation - accurate timing and correct colour data
  for all levels.
[Bryan McPhail]

Added the ability to clear an input configure via the delete key.
[Curt Coder]

Added cocktail flip support to the Qix driver. [Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed graphics in Hyper Crash. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli, David Haywood]

Rewrote 8255 PPI mode 2 support, and hooked 8255 to buckrog properly.
[Nathan Woods]

Fixed a number of bugs and added support for more SCSI commands and
modes. [R. Belmont, Ville Linde]

Hooked up MSM5205 to Goal! '92 and to Euro League (bootleg), but it
doesn't sound too good yet. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Cleaned up the decryption in the Epos games. [Nicola Salmoria]

Changed xday2 to use default namcona1 joystick inputs. With those, if 
you wait the initial test to finish, you can play it. [Sonikos]

Fixed L button in mj4simai which was missing. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added support for Single monitor Playchoice 10 BIOS. Since the core 
doesn't allow you to change aspect ratio or remove dual monitor flag at 
run-time, the game always runs in the upper part of the screen. 
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added a -debugscript command line parameter that invokes a debugger 
script on startup [Nathan Woods]

Modified the MIPS DRC core to disable optimizations when mame_debug is
on. This makes it easier to run comparative traces when running both 
with and without MIPS DRC enabled. [Nathan Woods]

Simplified the decryption code in the sun8 driver, and made some
improvements to the Brick Zone main set. [Nicola Salmoria]

Patched the non-DRC PPC core to compile properly when not all PPC 
cores (403, 602, 603) are enabled. Implemented fcmpo instruction.
[Nathan Woods]

Swapped On Screen Display and Config Menu items so that accidental
key configuration changes don't kill your ability to get to the menu
by default. [Aaron Giles]
