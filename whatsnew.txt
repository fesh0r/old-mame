initializing generic pointers in memory maps. Also added 
AM_BASE_SIZE_GENERIC to set both base and size in one step.
[Aaron Giles]

Moved global variables out of machine/generic and into a private data 
structure hanging off of the running_machine. Added newly-needed 
machine parameters to coin_counter_w, coin_lockout_w, and
coin_lockout_global_w. Also added machine parameter to 
set_led_state. [Aaron Giles]

Added interface functions to get the number of dispensed tickets and 
to increment the count, to remove the need for direct access to these 
global variables. Also added functions to get the current count on a 
particular coin counter and to determine the lockout state. 
[Aaron Giles]

Intel 8255A: clear input latch after reading it. [Curt Coder]

Added AM_BASE_SIZE_MEMBER() macro for specifying both base and size
structure members at once. Updated all cases where this could be
used. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up many driver data structs: [Fabio Priuli]
 * dropped almost completely the use of generic sizes with struct 
    members 
 * reduced as much as possible accesses to cputag calls during 
    emulation (they are now mainly concentrated at MACHINE_START & 
    DRIVER_INIT)

Joker's Wild: bypassed the rng test [Angelo Salese]

Joker's Wild: implemented bare minimum to allow it to go into gameplay 
and fixed tilemap graphics [Angelo Salese]
