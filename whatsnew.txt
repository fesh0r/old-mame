Source Changes
--------------
Fix for inverted RON / REACH buttons in kiwames [Angelo Salese, Fujix]

Ported PC CGA device emulation from MESS to MAME, and updated Filetto
and Tetris (KR) to use it accordingly [Angelo Salese]

Added proper background hook-up for Tetris KR [Angelo Salese]

Added preliminary superimposing flag for CGA, and implemented for
Tetris KR, now it properly mixes between CGA graphics and external
background [Angelo Salese]

Added 'buzzer' sound to Filetto and Tetris KR [Angelo Salese]

CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]:
 * Dumped and added MB63B.1A PAL to slammast and clones (Kold666)
 * Fixed mbomberj, mbombrd, mbombrdj Q-Sound ROMs labels and
    locations, added Q-Sound PALs

Worked around 0x3d8 VGA reading, and fixed California Chase in using
the right VGA card [Angelo Salese]

Hooked up a proper VGA card for Psychic Force 2012 (waiting for
further info about the VGA card used) [Angelo Salese]

Added Tourvision bios ver. 52 [f205v, Corrado Tomaselli]

Fixed Atari logo bad colors at POST in Area 51:Site 4 [Angelo Salese]

Change 'screen' parameter in SCREEN_UPDATE and SCREEN_EOF callbacks to
a reference. Remove redundant machine parameter from SCREEN_EOF.
Remove old vestiges of driver_device video_eof override since it
wasn't being used. Update all multi-screen games to use separate
functions for each screen (calling into common code where
appropriate). [Aaron Giles]

i8251: Implemented transmit and receive data callbacks [Barry
Rodewald]

arm7: implemented MMU permission faults [Tim Schuerewegen]

arm7: return correct MMU ID Code register values for ARM920T/ARM7500
[Tim Schuerewegen]

s3c24xx: lots of changes for future Happy Fish 302-in-1 and Palm Z22
(mess) drivers [Tim Schuerewegen]

chdman: fixed -extractcd of images with postgaps.  CHDs do not need
reconversion, this was an -extractcd problem only. [R. Belmont]

Implemented every single documented x87 co-processor opcodes in 386+
CPU cores [Angelo Salese]

Converted bitmap_t and rectangle into proper classes. Replaced
BITMAP_ADDR* macros with bitmap->pix* functions, and moved
bitmap_fill() to bitmap->fill() among other similar changes. Bitmap
fields now only available via accessors. Replaced sect_rect with &=
and union_rect with |= operators for rectangle classes. Some general
cleanup as a result of these changes. [Aaron Giles]

Implemented generic functions for RDMSR and WRMSR opcodes in Pentium
CPU core (i.e. no MSR is actually hooked up so far) [Angelo Salese]

Hooked up device in Savage Quest, dies at floppy error [Angelo Salese]

Hooked up devices for X-Tom 3d, gets to BOOT error if you soft reset
once [Angelo Salese]

segae.c: Updated driver to use the implementation from
src/emu/video/315_5124.c and modernized driver.
[Enik Land, Wilbert Pol]

Bulk converted cliprect * to cliprect & across the system. This makes
cliprects mandatory everywhere. In general, cliprects were being
correctly passed through the video side of most drivers already, so it
is mostly a semantic change. Note that with my previous change,
bitmaps have cliprects, so if you just want to clip to the bitmap's
boundaries, pass bitmap->cliprect() instead of NULL (which is no
longer permitted). [Aaron Giles]

68HC05: CLR instruction should not affect the carry flag.  Verified
with Freescale programmer's manual. [R. Belmont]

Hooked up basic devices in Queen and Midway Quicksilver HWs [Angelo
Salese]

mcr.c: added twotiger stereo 8-track tape sample playback
[italie, Mr. Do, hap]

Bulk conversion of bitmap_t * to bitmap_t & . With this change the
parameters for the global SCREEN_UPDATE callback match the parameters
for the driver_device version. Added allocate() and deallocate()
methods to bitmap_t to permit cleaner handling of bitmaps in drivers
and modern devices. [Aaron Giles]

m680x0: fix case where the MMU trashed memory [R. Belmont]

Removed machine.generic.tmpbitmap, VIDEO_START(generic_bitmapped), and
SCREEN_UPDATE(generic_bitmapped). In their place, each screen_device
now maintains a default bitmap which is automatically copied to the
screen on each update if no SCREEN_UPDATE function is provided and if
no driver_device::video_update override is present. This bitmap can be
found by querying the screen's new default_bitmap() method.
[Aaron Giles]

Hooked up devices and flash loading for Funky Ball, game currently dies
at a Voodoo color DAC register check [Angelo Salese]

Removed old C-based interface to astrings. astring exists only as a
class now. Updated all stragglers (mostly tools) to use the class
form. [Aaron Giles]

[R. Belmont]

Fix four spc700 opcodes which didn't disassemble correctly [kevtris]

i386: Moved stack changes to be after protection checks in RETF and
IRET Made ARPL protected mode only Added protection checks when MOVing
to a segment register. [Barry Rodewald]

Added delayed interrupts in idectrl to enable booting on some older
bioses [Carl]

scsihd.c: Get sector size from CHD metadata to support old 256
bytes/sector SASI drives, and allow hard disk image subdevices.
[Curt Coder]

started converting steppers to simulate actual behavior in a more
logical way, rather than using hardcoded tables [J. Wallace]

PGM driver cleanups. [David Haywood]
