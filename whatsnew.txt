Source Changes
--------------
Changed default DIP switches in onetwo.c. Common coinslot mode seems 
broken, or our code is wrong. [David Haywood]

Updated documentation in several drivers based on old readmes and 
other data that might get lost. [Andrew Gardner]

Fixed COP420 instructions JSRP, LBI, LQID, and SKT. Draco now has 
sound. Also fixed COP420 instructions XAS and INIL. Fixed cycle count 
for extended opcodes. Added CKO general purpose input. [Curt Coder]

Improvements to American Poker II driver. [Roberto Fresca]
 - Reworked the color routines switching to resnet system.
 - Added a resistor network diagram.
 - Switch to pre-defined crystal value.
 - Changed the WATCHDOG_TIME_INIT to be based on miliseconds instead 
    of hertz.
 - Other minor cleanup/fixes.
 - Updated technical notes.

peplus driver changes: [Jim Stolis]
 * Updated coin-in timing
 * Extended memory address range of DUART
 * Fixed overlapping input port bits

Fixed PORT_IMPULSE handling. The old code would force inputs to be 
asserted for at least the number of frames indicated, but keeping the 
button pressed would keep the input asserted. Now the input is 
asserted far exactly the number of frames indicated. [Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed memory access in the 80286 cpu core which made i286.h obsolete. 
Changed CPUINFO_INT_MAX_INSTRUCTION_BYTES to prevent crashes during 
disassembly. [Wilbert Pol]

Fixed behavior of toggle switches so that they don't lose their value
when the UI is up. They also can now be used for multibit DIP switch
settings in which case they toggle through all the options. Added
new functions input_field_select_next_setting() and 
input_field_select_previous_setting() which can be used to iterate
properly through DIP switches. Fixed the behavior for cases where
conditional ports are in play (you could get stuck). Changed uimenu.c
to call these instead of implementing its own. [Aaron Giles]

Changed uimenu.c so that hitting ENTER on a DIP switch resets it to
its default value. This is analagous to how the OSD sliders behave.
[Aaron Giles]

Renamed EEPROM_* to eeprom_*. Updated all drivers accordingly. 
Typedef'ed a real eeprom_interface structure. [Aaron Giles]

Added a PORT_CUSTOM for the eeprom bit reading. Updated several
drivers to use that by specifying it in their input ports instead
of having a custom read handler that inserted the bit forcefully.
Also added a PORT_CUSTOM for the ticket dispenser callback as well.
Updated the dcheese driver to use it. Many more drivers can be updated 
to use these new PORT_CUSTOMs in the future, eliminating hacky input 
port read handlers. [Aaron Giles]

Changed text used to specify a menu separator in uimenu.c, and added
a #define for the new string. [Nathan Woods]

Added TOKEN_SKIP_* macros to tokenize.h. [Aaron Giles]

Changed error reporting during input port detokenization to fill a 
buffer rather than fatalerror-ing immediately. Should now properly 
skip over any invalid tokens. Enhanced error detection during input 
port detokenization to catch duplicate bits. There are a lot of these!
Updated initialization code to print errors and fatal only if the 
input ports were unable to be constructed at all. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed duplicate input port bits in pacman.c, gottlieb.c, cps1.c,
megadriv.c, segae.c. [David Haywood]

Added support for a NULL set of input ports, used by the empty driver.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed cpu_getiloops() which was not returning the correct value.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Made gijoe not crash, but still don't understand what the original
code was trying to do. [David Haywood]

Moved suprpool to a better match hardware. Fixed the ROM load and 
added a list of PCB components. [Roberto Fresca]

Implemented autoload mode in 8257 DMA: [Miodrag Milanovic]
 * added support for autoload mode
 * fixed bug in calculating count

Fixed duplicate input port bits in dkong.c. [couriersud]

MIPS core changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - renamed struct mips3_config -> mips3_config
 - updated all drivers to the new names
 - removed MIPS3DRC_STRICT_COP0 flag, which is no longer used
 - a few minor cleanups
 - moved implementation-specific state into a pointer hanging off of 
   the core MIPS3 state
 - removed large context in favor of a pointer to the large context 
   to help improve context switch times

Changed the behavior of the translate callback in the CPU interface:
[Aaron Giles]
 - added new 'intention' parameter to the translate callback to
   indicate read/write/fetch access, user/supervisor mode, and
   a flag for debugging
 - updated all call sites to pass an appropriate value
 - updated all CPU cores to the new prototype

UML updates: [Aaron Giles]
 - added new opcode SETC to set the carry flag from a source bit
 - added new opcode BSWAP to swap bytes within a value
 - updated C, x86, x64 back-ends to support the new opcodes
 - updated disassembler to support the new opcodes

DRC frontend changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - fixed bug in handling edge case with the PC near the 0 or ~0
 - added new flag to tag privileged instructions

Added new option -snapname which lets you provide a template for how 
snapshot names are generated. See config.txt for details. [Aaron Giles]

Added new astring functions astring_del, astring_replace, and 
astring_replacec. [Aaron Giles]

Removed meaningless service_coin_lockout_w function. Updated the 
zaxxon driver to correctly handle the coin enable lines. 
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed bug that caused DIP switches to be improperly read from game 
cfg file in certain circumstances. [Aaron Giles]

Added internal default tags for input ports when saving/loading.
[Aaron Giles]

Updated cheat sytem drastically: [ShimaPong]

  * Supported (preliminary) new cheat format
     - Added new operations
        PDWWrite, RWrite, VRWrite, CWrite, Move, Branch, Loop, Popup
     - Added new options
        ValueSelectNegative, Return, AddressReadFrom, DataReadFrom
     - Added cheat variables
        You can store data with Write or Move operations and
        read as an address or data from each fields
     - Added condition check
        for CWrite, Branch and Popup operations
     - Added new custom codes
        Separator, Layer
     - Supported Shared Code [MESS ONLY]
        different machine shares common code for a game

  * Allowed mixed label-select or user-select with standard code

  * Added label selector menu for label-selection code

  * Added extend comment displayer for multi-line comments

  * Added command menu for cheat list and watchpoint
     Easy selectable cheat commands in this menu

  * Added debug view menu [DEBUG BUILD ONLY]
     It displays internal info to debug cheat system

  * Supported unique separator by ui_draw_menu() in several menus

  * Added user defined search region
     You can set free memory range from cheat database

  * Enhanced error check for cheat code to prevent from unexpected 
     working. Error code is locked. If you select this code, the 
     analyser works instead of the code activater

  * Enhanced value input with keyboard-less
     Cheat edit key gives new input system in several menus
     Left/right keys moves the edit cursor and up/down keys changes a 
     value

  * Added cheat command save, reload, reset in option menu

  * Supported address shift in searching
     Now searchable default region in TMS340*0 cpu games (Trog, 
     Smash T.V. etc)

  * Refined cheat menu handling with function pointer called 
     cheat_menu_handler

  * Added format strings table to manage in an integrated fashion

  * Deleted unused hacks of default search region for Neo Geo and 
     TMS34010

  * Refined code based on MAME coding guidelines
     - Renamed many functions/structures/constants
        But not complete due to too many items
     - Converted small but often used functions to INLINE
     - Fixed a comparison in case of 0 or NULL
     - Added missing function prototype for several functions

MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
01815: [Save/Restore] All Sets: Saved machine states do not properly 
       adjust to changes in -samplerate (Aaron Giles)
01671: [Interface] every set with PORT_MODIFY used for DIPs (e.g. 
       arknoidj): the modified dipswitches are always listed at the 
       bottom of the list (Aaron Giles)
01814: [Sound] YM2608 games (tail2nos, sformula, wc90, mechatt): Only 
       basic music, no more samples (couriersud)
01497: [Graphics] numanath, numanatj: Graphics corruption on 
       title screen. (Phil Stroffolino)
01804: [Core] carnevil, sfrush: Seattle games crash on startup 
       (Aaron Giles)



Source Changes
--------------
Fixed long-standing bug with Emeralda text colors. A sprite 
attribute exists which signals an alternate interpretation of 
palette ram. Fixed priority for the bitmap layer used in Numan 
Athletics. [Phil Stroffolino]

Restructured input port internals and cleaned up inptport.c:
[Aaron Giles]

    * Input ports are now maintained hierarchically. At the top
      level are input ports, which contain a list of fields. Each
      field represents one or more bits of the port. Certain fields
      such as DIP switches and configuration switches contain a
      list of settings, which can be selected. DIP switch fields
      can also contain a list of DIP switch locations.

    * Normalized behavior of port overrides (via PORT_INCLUDE or
      by defining multiple overlapping bits). All fields within a
      port are kept in strict increasing bit order, so altered DIP
      switches are now kept in the appropriate order. This addresses
      MAMETesters bug 01671.

    * Live port state is now fully separate from configured 
      state. This is manifested in a similar way to devices, where
      a const list of ports can be managed either offline or live.
      Each port has a pointer to an opaque set of live state which
      is NULL when offline or valid when live. Each port also has
      a running_machine * which is also NULL when offline.

    * Because of this new arrangement, the conversion from tokens
      to a list of ports now requires reasonably complex memory
      allocation, so these port lists must be explicitly allocated
      and freed (they are not mantained by automatic resource
      allocation).

    * Custom and changed callbacks now take a pointer to a field
      config instead of a running machine. This provides more
      information about what field triggered the change notification.
      The machine can be found by referenced field->port->machine.

    * The inptport.c module has been cleaned up and many 
      ambiguities resolved. Most of this is internal, though it did
      result in osd_customize_inputport_list() being changed to
      osd_customize_input_type_list(). The parameter to this function
      is now a linked list instead of an array, and the structures
      referenced have been reorganized somewhat.

    * Updated config.c to pass machine parameters to its callbacks.

    * Updated validity checks, XML output, and UI system to handle
      the new structures.

    * Moved large table of default input settings to a separate
      include file inpttype.h.

    * Removed gross hacks in trackfld and hyperspt NVRAM. These
      may be broken as a result.

Further Namco NA-1 changes: [Phil Stroffolino]
 * Adjusted alternate palette handling weights to more accurately 
   match real hardware - text anti-aliasing is much more noticable.
 * Adjustment to roz layer priority - prevents roz layer from 
   incorrectly being displayed over backgrounds in some games (i.e. 
   numanathj)
 * Added a mask when processing the roz tilemap to avoid defects in 
   emeraldj

Fixed black pixel patches present in the TC0100SCN fg layer of 
undrfire and groundfx. [Philip Bennett]

Universal DRC system updates and improvements: [Aaron Giles]

   UML:
    * Added back-end validation mechanism, and a handful of tests as 
      examples. This will be expanded in the future.
    * Added several new opcodes:
       - SAVE dumps the entire virtual machine state to a struct
       - RESTORE applies the data in a struct to the live state
       - LZCNT counts leading zeros in an operand
       - XTRACT extracts a bitfield to another register (rlwinm)
       - INSERT inserts a bitfield into a register (rlwimi)
    * Added new back-end function get_info() which returns information 
      from the back-end about how many actual registers will be 
      mapped.

   x86 back-end:
    * Implemented all new opcodes.
    * Implemented get_info() function.
    * Fixed several bugs relating to shifts/rotates and optimizing out
      cases incorrectly.

   x64 back-end:
    * Implemented all new opcodes.
    * Implemented get_info() function.
    * Added defines for new Penryn opcodes to x86emit.h.
    * Added support for ROUNDSS and ROUNDSD on Penryn architectures. 
      This hasn't been tested. If you have a Penryn-based system, 
      give it a try.
    * Fixed several bugs relating to shifts/rotates and optimizing out
      cases incorrectly.
   
   C back-end:
    * Implemented all new opcodes.
    * Implemented get_info() function.
    * Cleaned up operand sizing.
    * Fixed several errors that made it not work on bigendian systems

   MIPS DRC:
    * Added some instrumentation for the MMU. To enable it, turn on 
      PRINTF_MMU at the top of the file.
    * Fixed front-end so that virtual no-op instructions are still 
      targeted as branch targets.
    * Fixed front-end to mark the beginning of each sequence as 
      needing TLB validation, since any sequence can be jumped to 
      from anywhere.
    * Redid the MIPS3 TLB implementation. Fixed the exception vector 
      and type handling. Changed the bitfields to directly map from 
      the MIPS TLB format. Added distinction between TLB fill and TLB 
      valid/modified exceptions.
    * Added separate modes for user, supervisor, and kernel modes. 
      Each mode does proper verification of addresses now and 
      generates address errors for invalid accesses.
    * Fixed several bugs in the TLB implementation; not everything 
      works yet but it's a lot closer.
    * Made COP0 access checking mandatory in non-kernel modes.
    * Fixed several crashes when recompiling virtual no-ops.
    * Fixed TLB bug where entries for virtual address 0 were present 
      by default.
    * Fixed bug in the map variable implementation that would 
      sometimes result in incorrectly recovered values.
    * Implemented IDT instructions. All invalid instruction asserts 
      are now runtime-only.
    * Added support to map a few common registers to machine registers 
      if the machine supports it. Currently only x64 on Windows has 
      enough free registers to do so, though PowerPC will almost
      certainly be able to take advantage of this. Gives a minor 
      speedup.
    * Updated to use INSERT and XTRACT where appropriate.
    * Cleaned up register usage to free up one machine register for
      x64 on Linux.
  
Added World Rally wheel support. [Mirko Mattioli]

[David Haywood]

Fixed N64 rendering on big-endian targets. [R. Belmont]

Fixed CDP1869 character memory access, and Cidelsa sprite flashing.
[Curt Coder]

Fixed 80286 databus widths. [Wilbert Pol]

Added proper interpolation sub-cycles to the TMS5110 and TMS5220 
('PC' cycles and A/B subcycles of each) and updated comments. 
[Lord Nightmare]

Fixed World Rally MCU comms on big-endian. [R. Belmont]

Changed defaults so that joysticks are enabled standard. [Aaron Giles]

Some improvements to Sandii' games: [Roberto Fresca, f205v]
 - Confirmed the CPU clock after some PCB measurements.
 - Changed the SND clock to 1MHz to match the PCB measurement.
 - Corrected the internal OKI6295 frequency turning the pin 7 state to HIGH.
 - Inputs: Eliminated all pulse limitations.
   Affected buttons have a rattled sound in the real thing too.
 - Updated technical notes.

Corrected several bugs in the emulation of the saturn CPU. These 
corrections are needed to make new HP48 drivers (to be submitted to 
MESS imminently) work. [Antoine Mine]

Eliminated a large number of global Machine references. Added machine
parameters to IRQ callbacks throughout the system to help remove
more. Reduced the number of files needing deprecat.h by ~200.
[Atari Ace]

Some work on lwings.c: Input clean up, added dip locations, fixed 
lwingsb life DIP switches, and merged machine drivers. [Sonikos]

Updated Gorf sample volume to match new samples from Chris Law.
[Chris Law]

Added built-in overlay for Moon Shuttle. [Deacon Blue]

Source Changes
--------------
Improved cbombers sprites [Philip Bennett]

Renamed ports and used AM_READ_PORT macros in arcadecl. [stephh]

Add feature to the cia6526: in READ operation the value can be forced 
by a external circuit; this feature is necessary for MESS. [robiza]

undrfire.c improvements: [Philip Bennett]
 * Hooked up cbombers steering wheel input.
 * Changed ES5505 clock rate to 30476100/2.
 * Unified cbombers memory maps and tidied up some code.
 * Removed the undrfire speedup hack.

Marked the sound roms on Q*Bert's Qubes as bad and changed the flag to 
imperfect sound. The current sound cpu roms are the same as on a 
normal Q*Bert board, which is incorrect. At least three sound effects 
are present in the real qq-snd roms but not the Q*Bert qb-snd ones.
[Lord Nightmare]

Fixed the ROZ effect in Namco NA1 driver. ROZ tilemap is actually an 
additional tilemap. Fixes a bug where a "roz enable" test was causing 
a normal layer to be rendered with ROZ effects in-game. There is no 
roz enable register - it's always available for mixing with other 
tilemaps and sprites. This also adds a missing NAMCO logo zoom/spin 
effect in Emeralda's attract mode. [Phil Stroffolino]

Added memory address parameter to CDP1802 DMA callbacks, and added a 
macro for the CPU interface. [Curt Coder]

Rewrote the Gaelco video ram encryption, which finally makes sense.
The key observation was that when decrypting the second word, both 
encrypted and decrypted bits of the first word are used. Many thanks 
to Javier Valero for the detailed information that made this possible.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed coin inputs, added validator input, and added notes on inputs to
the tmaster driver. [Luigi30]

Merged memory maps for drivers: tagteam, tail2nos, tankbatt, tankbust, 
taotaido, targeth, and taxidrvr. [Andrew Gardner]

New driver for old Game-A-Tron gambling games hardware. 
[Roberto Fresca]
 - Properly decoded graphics.
 - Proper memory map.
 - Added NVRAM support.
 - Proper Inputs through 8255 PPI I/O chip.
 - Both games are working.
 - Added technical & game notes.

New universal dynamic recompiler system: [Aaron Giles]

    The central module is drcuml.c, which defines a universal 
    machine language syntax that can be generated by a frontend 
    recompiler and then retargeted via a generic backend 
    interface to any of a number of different architectures. A 
    disassembler for the UML is also included to allow 
    examination of the generated UML code.

    Currently supported backend architectures include 32-bit x86,
    64-bit x86, and a platform-neutral interpreted C backend that
    can be used as a fallback for platforms without native 
    support. The C backend also performs additional validation
    to ensure assumptions are met.

    Along with the new architecture is a new MIPS III/IV 
    recompiler frontend. This frontend has been rewritten from 
    the old x64-specific recompiler to generate UML opcodes
    instead. This means that the single recompiler can be used
    to target multiple backend architectures and should in
    theory produce identical results across all of them.

    The old 32-bit and 64-bit MIPS recompilers are now officially
    retired. The new system provides similar performance (within
    5% generally) to the old system and has similar compatibility.
    The only currently known issues are some problems with the
    two Gauntlet 3D games.

Added DS5002FP CPU core. [Manuel Abadia]

Added CDP1852 I/O buffer chip, and used it in Altair/Draco. 
[Curt Coder]

Found the proper algorithm to decrypt the blue TAB PCB in the funworld
driver. Replaced the old decryption tables with the proper decryption 
scheme. Updated technical notes. [Roberto Fresca]

Added uncompressed AVI recording: [Aaron Giles]

    Extended aviio to be able to write RGB bitmaps. Unfortunately, 
    the only option is fully uncompressed, which means the resulting 
    AVIs are *HUGE* and may not play correctly in realtime due to 
    high data rate. The intention is that these uncompressed AVIs 
    are post-processed by other utilities to compress the video and
