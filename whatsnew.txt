0.87

General Improvements:
--------------------

Small update to the Kaneko drivers [Sebastien Volpe]
	- correct dipswitches for bonkadv
	- galpanib protection moved to machine\kaneko16.c, and sandscrp uses it
	- merged read/write memory maps for the 3 galpanic sets

Support 16 Joystick buttons [Norix]

8-way input fix for some mappy.c games (grobda, motos, phozon)
These games were set to 4-way input in the previous update. [anonymous]

Various Improvements [Angelo Salese]
	vamphalf.c
	improvements to vamphalf making it almost playable* it actually
	is now playable thanks to further improvements from others (see
	below)

	yumefuda.c
	temporarly patched eeprom check,fixed the graphics bankswitching
	& added sound in Yumefuda.I don't have added controls yet so it
	isn't playable.
	
	acommand.c
	Preliminary driver for Alien Command.Doesn't work yet...

	gstriker.c
	Very preliminary MCU emulation for World Cup '94.Hangs in
	various places since I don't have worked on them yet...

Implements the LEDs in "copsnrob" [Stefan Jokisch]

Fixed res_net.h related crash in Strike Bowling [Jarek Burczynski]

Improvements to Paint and Puzzle, game is almost playable [Nicola Salmoria]

Taito F3 Improvements [Bryan McPhail]
	Recalhorn now up to a playable standard.  This game exposed some bugs in the
	way the sprite renderer handled the special command bits (ie, the sprite
	list jump command occurs _after_ the current sprite has been processed, not
	before, plus bankswitch & global positioning flags can be set on the same
	sprite - they aren't exclusive, all makes perfect sense from a hardware
	point of view).  These fixes really should be put into taito_f2 and hybrid
	f3 games as well, though I doubt it will make any visual difference.
	
	Command War is playable too, except for the fact a layer doesn't seem to
	disappear when in the fighting sequence, and it's offset by 8 pixels in the
	movement sequence.

Rohga driver Improvements [Bryan McPhail]
	Rohga - Despite massive amounts of time spent on writing trojan's to probe
	the protection this still isn't complete.  The game hangs at the end of
	level 5.  A quick look at decoprot.c should reveal just how nasty this game
	is...  Graphics emulation is complete but the priority register never seems
	to be written properly (protection?) so some things look wrong.
	
	Schmeiser Robo - Not working 100%.  The game puts graphics info through the
	protection chip so in this case the game looks wrong even though the
	gameplay is actually running correctly.  Uses a strange double buffer
	feature of the protection chip that the Deco games don't (seem to) use.

Truco Clemente driver [Ernesto Corvi]
	This is as good I could get it working...
	Problems:
	- Wrong Colors
	- Audio is not 100% yet, I think.
	
	The board is definitely a conversion of some other board. My guess is a 
	Pacman-style board, since
	some of the addresses match (watchdog, etc). Maybe somebody more 
	familiar with those type
	of boards can figure out if they used the same color proms (I tried the 
	MsPacman ones, and didn't
	match).
	
SPI background Decryption improvements [Ville Linde] 

Fixed mrtnt colours (verified to use pacman proms) [vernimark]

Hyperstone core fixes [Tomasz Slanina, Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
	Tomasz Slanina
	- Added "undefined" C flag to shift left instructions

	Pierpaolo Prazzoli
	- Added interrupts-block for delay instructions
	- Fixed get_emu_code_addr
	- Added LDW.S and STW.S instructions
	- Fixed floating point opcodes

	and ncv2 are now fully playable with full sound and
	music.
	
Hyper Neogeo 64 Improvements [David Haywood]
	I won't be doing much work on this again until I buy some more RAM
	so don't expect too much.  Needs a kludge in the MIPS core so the
	changes aren't very visible in a normal build (details of the
	required kludge are in the source)

Gottlieb Input Changes [B.S.Ruggeri]

CPU / Sound Core Improvements
-----------------------------

H8/3002 Fixes [R.Belmont]
	- Fixed btst #imm, @Rn instruction - it was giving
	reversed results, which crashed ncv2's MCU program.

	- Many many fixes to wave start/end/bank handling plus
	added chain mode support.  Thanks to cap @ VivaNonno
	for the tips.

General Improvements:
--------------------

CHDMAN update [R.Belmont]
	This makes the parser deal with .toc files output by
	current cdrdao better.  I need to just give in and
	rewrite it for 2-pass operation sometime, it'll be
	much cleaner then.

	Incidentally, if anyone has any idea where to get
	specs for e.g. CloneCD or some other popularish image
	format(s) let me know and I'll add support.

Fixed for the random key mappings bug with new config system [Aaron Giles]

Input Port Fixes [Aaron Giles]
	- reversed pedals now work correctly (e.g., brake in Hard Drivin')

	of the number of bits allocated for that port

0.86u2

Quick update but since there have been some large submissions I feel it is
worthwhile

--------------------

Misc Updates [R.Belmont]
	m37710.diff:

	know how to control PC case fans from software?  Prop
	Cycle's "fan" output is bit 1 of 37710 port 5... ;-)
	- Added LDB absolute and DIV direct opcodes.
	- Rewrote the RLA instruction.  Pretty much everything
	was wrong with it including the result, flags, and
	cycle count.
	- Fixed disassembly for RLA.
	
	flash.diff:
	- Added word-wide flash ROM support (specifically IDs
	itself as the Sharp LH28F400 found on Konami "Beat the
