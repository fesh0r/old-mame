         (R. Belmont)



Source Changes
--------------
Added default nvrams to the ST-V driver [David Haywood]

Improve text layer in LE2: [David Haywood]
 * set display enable to be ON by default.  LE2 doesn't turn it on
    until after the test screens, which would seem to indicate that
    the register should default to on, otherwise they're always
    invisible.
 * added a kludge to use the right palette for the text layer in LE2,
    I haven't checked, but I wonder if this could also be related to
    internal defaults for the mixer chip which the game doesn't
    change.
This allows you to see the ram/rom tests anyway, which is better than
an invisible startup.

680x0 FPU updates [R. Belmont]
 * Rewritten to use SoftFloat instead of unportable native FP math
 * Support added for Motorola 96-bit extended floats
 * More addressing modes and conditions supported

Updates to toaplan1.c driver: [Quench]

    RGN_FRAC calculations.
 * Fixed graphics bitplanes to involved games.
 * Added more hardware/technical info.
 * Modify the mongolnw machine driver. Now can see it starts.

    bipolar PROM redumps.

680x0 FPU update: [R. Belmont]
 * Implemented FMOVECR
 * Added load extended PC relative indexed support
 * Cleanup some duplicated code

Added Fun World Quiz description, and hardware notes. [Roberto Fresca]

 * Reworked button-lamps layouts per game. Cleaned-up the code.
 * Added specific button-lamps layout for bigdeal games.
 * Added specific button-lamps layout for royalcrd & jolycdit, but
    there is a bug in the d-up select code that lights the wrong lamp.
    This is a leftover from jollycrd routines.
 * Flagged vegasfte as GAME_NOT_WORKING, since is not receiving any
    coins or remote credits anymore.

hng64 : Lighting calculations are now more accurate. [Andrew Gardner]

Added driver data class and save states to: paradise.c, pasha2.c and
pbaction.c. [Fabio Priuli]

Enabled saves states in pass.c (everything was already saved)
[Fabio Priuli]

snes.c: reworked OAM drawing routines, implemented correct range over
and time over flags (sprite limits), implemented FirstSprite priority
[Fabio Priuli]

snes.c: moving more variables to driver data class and
refactoring/cleaning up some code [Fabio Priuli]

NamcoS21 cleanups [David Haywood]
 * Added default NVRAM to Cybersled
 * Limited the range of the analog inputs in Cybersled (the game
    glitches, causing you to move backwards if they hit the minimum /
    maximum)
 * Setup default key mapping in Cybersled to be similar to other dual
    joystick 'tank' style games, eg. Assault, rather than the default
    keyboard mapping where the sticks appear to be swapped.
 * Reworked the input ports a bit so that they include a common base
    rather than duplicating common inupts
 * Renamed aircombu to aircomb, and made it the parent instead of the
    Japanese set.

Cave cleanups [David Haywood]
 * Removed fake Region dipswitch that modified the region byte in the
    EEPROM each reset for Sailor Moon, Air Gallet and Mazinger Z
 * Split out different regions into clones with different default
    EEPROMs instead, and ensured all EEPROMs are factory default for
    that region. (this is a cleaner solution and more accurately
    represents the PCBs)

dynax.c, ddenlovr.c: Added driver data class [Fabio Priuli]

tlcs90.c: added save states [Fabio Priuli]

ddenlovr.c, dynax.c: replaced memory_set_bankptr with memory_set_bankp
and added save state support [Fabio Priuli]

spc700.c: Added save states [Fabio Priuli]

snes.c: Updated the snes sound device to use device handlers, to store
its internals in a struct, and to save them [Fabio Priuli]

i386: fixed unaligned memory accesses and opcode fetches when they
cross a page boundary. Previously, if pages were not ordered in
contiguous RAM, then a cross-boundary read or write would read
partially incorrect data or write some of the data in the wrong page.
[Barry Rodewald]

png2bdc.c: When the usage is printed, the name displayed was "png2bdf"
instead of "png2bdc"; this changes it by retrieving the name of the
executable at runtime, so it will always be correct now.
[Christophe Jaillet]

several cleanups based on cppcheck and VS2008 Code Analysis
[Oliver Stoeneberg]

split.c: made the "split" return the actual result instead of just 0.
[Oliver Stoeneberg]

GAME_NO_COCKTAIL flag until flip screen is implemented. [Tafoid]

Fixed spinner input in moonwarp, added notes about spinner board,
marked game as working. [Lord Nightmare]

Imported the same implementation of moon war proto's spinner to moon
war 2; works much more smoothly now. [Lord Nightmare]

Fix very minor occasional glitches in moonwar/moonwara/moonwarp
spinners caused by IPT_DIAL crossing the 0x00<->0xFF border. Added
conditional Hyperflip button to moonwar, only seems present in upright
mode? (in cocktail mode the same input is used by player 2 for a
different button) [Lord Nightmare]

Implement many of the dipswitches for moonwarp, and re-add the color
test mode to frenzy; Cocktail/upright select is still missing from
moonwarp, though I managed to trigger cocktail mode a few times by
accident. Needs code study to see what it actually depends on. The p2
controls are separate in cocktail mode. [Lord Nightmare]

Fixed for good trasparency issues in Three Dealers Casino House
[Angelo Salese]

snes.c: some internal refactoring, some new debug functions and a
small mode7 fix [Fabio Priuli]

Changed default initial state of PIC8259 to STATE_READY
[Miodrag Milanovic]

First step in refactoring the video system in metro.c driver
[David Haywood]

Corrected typo in Yie Ar Kung-Fu verified clock rates and tweaked the
tempo slightly to better match reference recordings. 
[Corrado Tomaselli, Tafoid]

Final step in refactoring the video system in metro.c driver, replaced
the video code with custom renderer functions [David Haywood]

 * Added dual-state palette (addressable through PLDs). This allow to
    choose which half of the palette will be addressed.
 * Splitted the main machine driver to cover both palette states.
 * Reworked inputs / DIP switches for vegasslw, vagasfst and vegasfte.
 * Created new default NVRAM for Royal Vegas Joker Card sets. These
    need to be configurated to be valid ones. Now vegasfte can receive
    remote credits, and all three in the family have valid min-max bet
    value and payout.
 * Removed the not working flag from vegasfte.
 * Improved colors for Big Deal sets.
 * Correct colors for Royal Vegas Joker Card sets.

Hooked up default NVRAM in Five A Side Soccer [David Haywood]

MN10200 updates: [R. Belmont]

chips to store their variables in struct and to save them
[Fabio Priuli]

More improvements to funworld.c driver [Roberto Fresca]
 * Added a second set of Jolly Card Professional. Documented the code
    differences.
 * Added another Royal Vegas Joker Card set, from Mile. These sets
    aren't intended to work with coins. Only remote credits are
    allowed. There are external modules that can manage up to 4
    machines simultaneously, adding/removing/watching credits.
