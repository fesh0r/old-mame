Source Changes
--------------
-i386: xlat implementation fix [Alegend45]

-Fixed a sign bug with CVT.WS opcode in v810 CPU core [Angelo Salese]

-Updated netlist implementation: [Couriersud]
 * Now supports any resolution fitting reasonably into a UINT64
 * Execution now uses a list sorted by execution time
 * Implementation now supports analog and digital inputs / outputs
 * First step in a move to "terminals" being both input / output
 * Improved object model
 Pong:
 * Rewrote video code, now emulates a monitor by analyzing the analog
    video signal and identifying vsync and hysnc pulses.
 * Removed all hacks.
 Overall performance increase of about 10% over the previous "pongf"
 implementation.

-patch that enables output of <info> elements stored in software lists
 through -listsoftware [qmc2]

-Continuing new device implementation for SN76496 and clones - mrdo.c,
 pachifev.c, tp84.c  [Osso]

-Flicker: added remaining inputs, some notes, sound (of sorts), marked
 as working. [Robbbert]

-Implemented remaining BSU opcodes in V810 CPU core [Angelo Salese]

 working [Robbbert]

-Fixed G-Stream G2020's sound banking. Compared with a real PCB and
 everything sounds as it should.  [trap15]

 allows all remaining unsupported sets to accept dollar bills in-game. 
 The protocol is switchable via driver configuration (along with
 denomination). [Jim Stolis]

-Shared palette fix for certain sms-based games in Mega Tech 
 [David Haywood]

-Added Swedish/Finnish SDL keymaps for OSX and Linux. [Curt Coder]

-ppc: Implemented PPC403 DMA chaining [Ville Linde]

-Created new sprite device base class, which manages a bitmap and a
 sparse bitmap for tracking which areas got updated. This allows
 sprites to be rendered independently to their own bitmap and then
 mixed in a final step. Converted the Sega sprite device over to this
 new model, and moved the mixing steps out of the sprite
 implementations and into the driver- specific video updates where it
 belongs. [Aaron Giles]

-Added some further methods and helpers to the bitmap_t and rectangle
 classes. [Aaron Giles]

-Created a sega_16bit_common_base class which handles the common Sega
 palette RAM mappings and open bus reads. [Aaron Giles]

-nwk-tr.c: Improved LAN controller emulation [Ville Linde]

 deadconx, deadconxj  [Tafoid]

-taito_x.c: Corrected the rom names for the Superman sets. Added info about 
 an alternate rom layout using a daughter card and half sized mask roms. 
 Changed Gigandes (Japan) to Gigandes (earlier) as both sets support 
 English / Japanese via dipswitch. But one set has a revised and corrected 
 service mode.  [Brian Troha, Dave France, The Dumping Union]

-Improved SPC700 cycle opcode timings [Angelo Salese, byuu]

-Fixed a major bug with 5A22 timings, that was incorrectly taking extra
 steals at every read, write and rmw types of opcode [Angelo Salese]

-Moved multiplication and division operation from SNES to 5A22 CPU core
 file [Angelo Salese]

-Updated looping.c to use the new tms52xx device implementation. [Osso]

 D9060HD & ACB4070 devices to do the same thing [smf]

-Numerous jedutil tool improvements.  [Kevin Eshbach]

 Made some modifications to the jedutil tool to allow the viewing of
 simple combinatorial jeds (adding support for registered and gals in
 the future) by taking a jed file and printing out human-readable
 equations.  Changed the command line options of the jedutil tool to
 know take an initial argument to specify what the tool should do.

 For example to convert a jed to bin the command is now: jedutil
 –convert <source.jed> <dest.bin> jedutil –convert <source.bin>
 <dest.jed>

 To view a jed file with human-readable equations the command is
 jedutil –view <source.jed> <pal type>

-gfx_element is now a class. Accessors are provided for all necessary
 elements. Updated some of the more, ah, creative uses/abuses of the
 gfx_elements. [Aaron Giles]

-Split out callbacks from scsibus_device into scscb_device, eventually
 this will be a SCSI device. SCSIBus_interface is no longer required
 and has been removed. [smf]

-PowerPC: 100% pass of integer portion of PPCTorture on all DRC
 backends. [R. Belmont]

 improving Godzilla, Heated Barrel and SD Gundam RT gameplay
 [Angelo Salese, Smitdogg]

-Generalized the PLS100 into a PLA device of variable amounts of
 inputs/outputs/terms. [Curt Coder]

-In device_state_interface, rename state() to state_int() and
 set_state() to set_state_int() for consistency. Update all callers.
 Also add set_pc() helper and updated all callers to use that instead
 of set_state_int(STATE_GENPC) [Aaron Giles]

-Added device_t::state() method to get the state interface. Added
 redundant device_state_interface::state() method to catch redundant
 use of it. [Aaron Giles]

-segac2.c: Corrected the rom names for ThunderForce AC. [Arzeno Fabrice]

-Removed cpu_get_reg() and cpu_set_reg() macros in favor of using the
 above methods. [Aaron Giles]

-Add ambiguous execute() and memory() methods to the
 device_execute/memory_interfaces respectively in order to catch
 unnecessary usage of the corresponding device_t methods. Removed all
 existing redundant usage. [Aaron Giles]

-merit.c: Added dipswitches to the Pit Boss sets with dipswitch
 locations. Reordered sets from oldest to newest. Added
 GAME_NO_COCKTAIL flag as these games support a cocktail mode.

 cputag_set_input_line_and_vector, replacing them with
 machine.device("tag")->execute().set_input_line[_and_vector].

 documentation. [Brian Troha]

-meritm.c: Added PCB layout and pinout for the Merit CRT-250 PCB.
 [Brian Troha]

 conversion. [R. Belmont]

-Made accurate trigonometry maths in Seibu COP [Angelo Salese,
 Smitdogg]

-Rewrote the SAA5050 Teletext character generator. Removed saa505x.c
 which was used by bbc.c, and refactored all drivers to use the new
 implementation. [Curt Coder]

-idetrl.c - Support IDE command 0x31
 (IDE_COMMAND_WRITE_MULTIPLE_NORETRY) [Phil Bennett]

 measured clocks as listed in the driver. Added a note about a Splash!
 PCB with alternate (higher) OSC clocks. Added a note about The Return
 of Lady Frog 9 rom and the 1 bit difference between the two sets.
 [Brian Troha]

-Fixes so MESS on PowerPC OS X builds and works again.  MAME is still a
 lost cause. [R. Belmont]

    part.
 * Design prepared to merge in discrete components from discrete.*
 * Supports code based as well as external net list parsing.
   Ultimately, net lists and discrete emulation should share one code
   base. The class design was set up to accomplish this. There is no
   point in having multiple 555, 7474 implementations around. Most of the
   code will be moved to lib/netlist going forward to allow usage in
   other projects.

- Pong now uses netlist.h. This implementation reproduces all gate

  bug#03990 as well.  [James Wallace]

- naomi: Make illvelo boot, probably others too [O. Galibert]

- model2.c: Updated several sets with Sega's game and / or ROM board
