Nintendo 8080 hardware update [Stefan Jokisch]

The driver has now been split into three parts. A few features that have been missing
in Helifire since my last update are back, i.e. the flickering colors when you're shot
and the volume decay effect (this affects the melody at the start of a game and a few
tunes that can be heard during the bonus scenes every twelve attack waves). The
starfield should now scroll at the correct speed, it's only 75% of what it used to be.
Finally, I have decided to use the color prom from Space Fever in Space Launcher, I
think it's correct.
