Improvements to the Polygonet Commanders driver: [Andrew Gardner]
 * Implemented various dsp56k opcodes
 * Polygonet Commanders now gets past the memory tests

Fixed the background color in perfrman. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Merged in some MESS-specific PC support code. [Nathan Woods]

Added mosaic effect to valtric. Yes, it looks as bad on real hardware
as in MAME :) [Tomasz Slanina]

Fixed colors in Honey Dolls. [David Haywood]

Added the final filtering stages to the sound, proper watchdog and 
memory mirroring to the circusc driver. Also added PORT_DIPLOCATION 
info and save state support. [Derrick Renaud]

Updated vconv.c to support preprocessor and assembly file output in
MSVC builds. [Nathan Woods]

Improved DIP switches for Honey Dolls and Twin Adventure. 
[Brian Troha]

Removed the "Autocenter Speed" menu entry for Analog Controls that do 
not use it. [Derrick Renaud]

Added a "Digital Speed" of 0 in the "Analog Controls" menu. This will 
cause the control to only inc/decrement once per button press no 
matter how long the button is pressed. Remember this is still scaled 
by the "Sensitivity" setting. [Derrick Renaud]

Scaled Windows mouse Z axis by 30 to make it usable. Most mice 
inc/decrement by 120 for each wheel click. Some rare ones are 30. So 
this means for most mice, using a Sensitivity setting of 25%, you 
will get 1 inc/decrement for each wheel click. [Derrick Renaud]

Cleaned up the cclimber driver, replacing hacks for cannonb with a
separate video update callback. [Mamesick]

Moved the ST-V protection related code into stvprot.c and added some 
notes about the decathlete protection and renamed stvhacks to 
stvinit, because it contains most of the inits as well as the 
speedhacks. [David Haywood]

Major funworld driver rewrite: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Merged/splitted some machine drivers, memory maps and inputs.
 - Unified get_bg_tile_info for all games.
 - Mapped the input buttons in a better format (all games).
 - Added proper color PROM decode routines.
 - Splitted the driver to driver/vidhrdw.
 - Corrected the screen size and visible area to magiccrd.
 - Added the remaining 2 GFX planes to magiccrd; GFX are imperfect.
 - Royalcrd: Added all inputs and DIP switches.
 - Fixed jolycdcr gfx to 4bpp.
 - Other fixes to get jolycdcr running.
 - Managed royalcdb to work, using the 2nd half of program ROM.
 - Managed jolycdit to work, but with imperfect graphics.
 - Fixed CPU clock to 2MHz. in all remaining games.
 - Fixed ay8910 frequency based on elephfam audio.
 - Fixed ay8910 volume in all games to avoid clipping.
 - Reworked jolycdcr, jolycdit inputs.
 - Set jolycdat as bigdeal clone. 
 - Added the bipolar PROM and GAL to jolycdit. 
 - Added color PROMs to cuoreuno and elephfam sets. 
 - Corrected jollycrd screen size and visible area.
 - Hooked, wired and decoded the color prom in jollycrd sets.
 - Wired and decoded the color prom in cuoreuno and elephfam sets.
 - Wired and decoded the color prom in royalcrd.
 - Hooked, wired and decoded the color prom in bigdeal sets.
 - Decrypted jolycdit gfx roms.
 - Decrypted jolycdae and managed the planes to show correct colors.

Minor Unicode changes for the Windows code. [Nathan Woods]

Added serial in/out support to the Amiga hardware. Added hooks for
output pins and light pen positioning. Also fixed the horrible static 
at startup in the debug build. [Aaron Giles]

Reorganized the laserdisc support a bit to accommodate new players.
Added Sony LDP-1450 support. [Aaron Giles]

Added new render texture format TEXFORMAT_YUY16, which is used to
hold 4:2:2 Y/Cb/Cr format pixels. Updated the Windows Direct3D code
and the software renderers to use this format directly. [Aaron Giles]

Added new render texture fromat TEXFORMAT_PALETTEA16, which is the
same as TEXFORMAT_PALETTE16 but respects the alpha component of the
palette entry. Updated the Windows Direct3D code and the software
renderers to use this format. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the render system to respect blendmodes for screen elements
rather than hard-coding them. This allows individual VIDEO_UPDATE
routines to do their own compositing. [Aaron Giles]

Removed the illusion from the rendering system that you could pass in
arbitrary palettes. The system palette is all that is supported.

Source Changes

SCSI CD emulation improvements: [Ville Linde]
 - Added Play Audio (12) command
 - Fixed track number and added MSF support to Read Sub-Channel 
    command

Added workaround for broken MediaGX driver. [Ville Linde]

Reworked the SNES raster timing to use MDRV_SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS() and 
friends. All but one of the "electronics tests" in the SNES 
diagnostics cart now pass with flying colors. [R. Belmont]

Fixed Super Breakout layout. [Mr. Do]

CPS2 updates: [David Haywood]
 - Added table for Jyangoku (from Guru). Note that GFX/Sound roms 
    aren't dumped on this one.
 - Removed old 'handcrafted' xors for games which we have CHDs for 
    and replaced them with xors generated from MAME using the CHD.  
    This means anyone with the CHD can easily generate the xors 
    (using the code I've left in there) if they need to be able to 
    run the games with a shorter startup time.
 - Disabled the loading of the xors by default for all sets with a 
    CHD. Now only the CHD is loaded, unless the #define is changed 
    at the top in which case only the xors generated from the CHD 
    are loaded.

Added support for more than 4 mouse buttons on versions of Windows 
that support it. Win98/Me with DX7+ or XP. It defaults to regular 4 
buttons if not supported. [Derrick Renaud]

Fixed the crosshairs in the PlayChoice-10 gun games that got 
buggered in the conversion to multi-monitor support. [Derrick Renaud]

Rewrote the Dragon's Lair driver from the schematics. Added new
module machine/laserdsc.c which has laserdisc emulation for the
PR-7280 and LD-V1000 laserdisc players. Full emulation of the
laserdisc is pending support for CHD audio/video and high quality 
rips, but you can operate the game and see the frame numbers that
would be displayed. Added built-in layout to display the scores, 
lives, and credit information. [Aaron Giles]

Added some hacks to windows.mak to allow limping compilation under
Windows Vista. To make these work set an environment variable called
VISTA_MINGW_ROOT equal to the base of your mingw directory, and add
%VISTA_MINGW_ROOT%\libexec\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2 to your PATH environment.
There are still a few issues, but this will let you build with MSVC,
and will compile most of the code with gcc (minus a couple of Windows
OSD files). Hopefully the mingw folks will resolve these issues.

Added raw decryption table to choko. Enabled the use of the large
CHD-based tables by default. [David Haywood]

Changed kram3 decryption to use external tables instead of hard-
coded ones in the source. [Atari Ace]

STV fixes: [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
 - vdp2: fixed vertical scrolling for RGB bitmaps (fixes corrupted
    gfx in batmanfr)
 - vdp2: fixed vertical line scrolling for zoomed layers (fixes
    corrupted backgrounds in astrass)
 - stv:  added speedup for master sh2 in batmanfr

Fixed bug in overflow handling and SUBC emulation in the TMS32010
core. [Rainer Keuchel]

Reverted Mario Bros. graphics offset since it caused issues 
elsewhere. [Derrick Renaud]

Enhanced chd.c to support hunk sizes up to 16MB, versus the previous
64k limit. [Aaron Giles]

Added hooks to chd.c to specify codec-specific configuration info.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed obsolete timing parameter from stream_update(). [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up cdrom.c. Removed audio implementation and relocated code
into sound/cdda.c. Changed metadata format to be textual instead of
binary (old metadata format is still supported). Removed external
access to CHD positions; all accesses are now done at the physical
LBA level and converted internally. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for split CHD files. CHD files can be transparently
split into multiple pieces and left that way during read access.
Modifications to split files are always written to the last file.
A new command chdman -split is now available to split an existing
CHD file. [Aaron Giles]

Added new option -fontpath to control where the font files are loaded
from. [Aaron Giles]

Added ability for options_add_entries() to override defaults 
specified in the core. To do this, simply include an option in the
list with the same name as the core option and provide a new default.
This default will override the one specified in the core.
[Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------
Fixed flags access in the i286 core. [Barry Rodewald]

Updated MC146818 module to use new core date/time routines.
[Nathan Woods]

Cleaned up disassemblers to remove stubs and ensure the disassemblers
are not referenced except in debug builds. [Nathan Woods]

Added support for using CHDs to decrypt CPS2 games. This code is
disabled for the moment, but will be enabled in the future. Only a 
handful of games have complete tables so far. These tables are huge 
(~4GB) and uncompressable until the encryption algorithm is 
understood. [David Haywood]

Fixed bug in the debugger that caused watchpoints to not be active
until the next context switch. [smf]

Cleaned up the input definitions for n-way joysticks so they are
more explicit. Added concept of a "16-way" joystick, which is a
joystick that doesn't prevent simultaneous opposing directions from
bring reported. [smf]

Major System 573 update: [smf]
 * fixed PSX SIO control register behavior
 * implemented several SCSI CD commands: START/STOP UNIT, PAUSE/
    RESUME, READ SUB-CHANNEL, READ TOC
 * added uPD4701 emulation
 * fixed ATAPI reset, PIO, and command IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE 
 * hooked up controls for fishing, DRR, and Guitar Freaks games
 * hooked up CDDA audio
 * removed some unused bytes from the Konami 80's security chips

Fixed upside down service mode in the commando.c driver. [Canim]

Added support for the Triple Hunt 8-track audio. [Derrick Renaud]

Galaxian/Scramble driver reorganization: [Atari Ace]
 * machine/scramble.c is broken up into two files, 
    machine/galaxian.c and machine/scramble.c
 * drivers/amidar.c, drivers/frogger.c, drivers/scobra.c get copies 
    of some of the data structures they shared from other drivers 
 * galaxian_base is made static and uses outside of the main driver
    were rewritten
 * cclimber_decode code from drivers/cclimber.c was separated into 
    its own machine/cclimber.c file to allow mshuttle to share it 
    without taking on other dependencies

Added missing x-flipping support in Major Havoc. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Made some improvements to trivia madness driver. There still is 
something wrong in the question roms banking. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

More updates to the ST-V driver: [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
 * vdp1: added shading for sprites (used by znpwfv, cotton, others)
 * vdp1: fixed sprite clipping (fixes incorrect sprites in znpwfv)
 * vdp1: fixed transparency on colour lookup table sprites (fixes bad
          sprites in znpwfv)
 * vdp2: fixed caching of RGB layer (fixes bad backgrounds on bosses 
          in rsgun)
 * vdp2: added additive blending for tilemaps and sprites (rsgun)
 * vdp2: added vertical line scroll and linezoom (fixes diehard logo)
 * stv:  improved speedups for diehard
 * stv:  fixed speedups for znpwfv
 * stv:  added preliminary save state support

Significant cleanup of chd.c: [Aaron Giles]
 * got rid of the horrible last_error concept; now all routines 
    return an error directly
 * fixed several issues in managing metadata 
 * changed compression and verification routines to be client-driven 
    rather than monolithic
 * changed internal codec usage to be more flexible
 * altered chdman and MAME to use the new interfaces
 * added new -createraw command for creating raw data CHDs

Fixed crash bug in romcmp when comparing ZIP files. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for Fixed Interval Timer to the PPC403 core.
[Ville Linde]

Polygonet Commanders update: [Andrew Gardner]
 * Added more accurate host interface to dsp56k core
 * Removed a bunch of hacks in plygonet.c

Added new field Machine->basename which is used to describe the path
used for various file accesses. This is a helper for MESS, and should
not have any user-visible changes. The file accesses affected are:
configuration (cfg) files, snapshots, debugger comments, NVRAM,
and memory cards. [Aaron Giles]

Changed naming of screenshots. They are now created in separate
folders per game, with numeric names 0000.png, 0001.png, etc.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed artwork layout loading to load either gamename/gamename.lay
or gamename/default.lay. The latter is preferred, and allows for
easier reuse of layouts between games. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed max instruction bytes for 68020+ CPUs to avoid assertion in
new disassembler. [Aaron Giles]

Added flip screen offsets needed with new video parameters in the
pacman.c driver. [Aaron Giles]
