Converted address_space to a class, and moved most members behind
accessor methods, apart from space->machine and space->cpu. Removed
external references to 8le/8be/16le/16be/32le/32be/64le/64be. All
external access is now done via virtual functions
read_byte()/read_word()/etc. Moved differentiation between the
endianness and the bus width internal to memory.c, and also added a
new axis to support small/large address spaces, which allows for
faster lookups on spaces smaller than 18 bits. [Aaron Giles]

Provided methods for most global memory operations within the new
address_space class. Updated callers to use these instead of the
old global functions. [Aaron Giles]

Created new module delegate.h which implements C++ delegates in a form
that works for MAME. Details are in the opening comment. Delegates
allow member functions of certain classes to be used as callbacks,
which will hopefully be the beginning of the end of fetching the
driver_data field in most callbacks. All classes that host delegates
must derive from bindable_object. Today, all devices and driver_data
do implicitly via their base class. [Aaron Giles]

Added an alternate set of address map macros. Now, if you #define
ADDRESS_MAP_MODERN prior to #including "emu.h", you will get the new
macros, which have the following properties: [Aaron Giles]
 * ADDRESS_MAP_START takes a 4th parameter, which is the name of the
    driver_data class the other macros will reference
 * AM_READ/AM_WRITE/etc. all assume you are providing method names off
    of the driver_data class you originally specified
 * AM_READ_LEGACY/AM_WRITE_LEGACY macros are provided for calling
    global static functions of yore
 * AM_BASE/AM_SIZE all assume you are providing member names off of
    the driver_Data class
 * AM_BASE_LEGACY/AM_SIZE_LEGACY are provided to reference globals if
    necessary

Defined delegates for read/write handlers. The new delegates are
always passed an address_space reference, along with offset, data, and
mask. Delegates can refer to methods either in the driver_data class
or in a device class. To specify a delegate in an address map, you
must #define ADDRESS_MAP_MODERN before including emu.h, at which
point the AM_READ/AM_WRITE macros will require member function pointers
into your driver_data class. Delegates that are specified in an address 
map are proto-delegates which have no object; they are bound to their 
object when the corresponding address_space is created. [Aaron Giles]

Added machine->m_nonspecific_space which can be passed as the required
address_space parameter to the new read/write methods in legacy
situations where the space is not provided. Eventually this can go
away but we will need it for a while yet. [Aaron Giles]

Added methods to the new address_space class to dynamically install
delegates just like you can dynamically install handlers today.
Delegates installed this way must be pre-bound to their object.
[Aaron Giles]

Moved beathead's read/write handlers into members of beathead_state as
an example of using the new delegates. This provides examples of both
static (via an address_map) and dynamic (via install_handler calls)
mapping using delegates. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the DIRECT_UPDATE_CALLBACKs into delegates as well. Updated
all users to the new function format. Added methods on
direct_read_data for configuring the parameters in a standard way to
make the implementation clearer. Updated all users. [Aaron Giles]

Created a simple_list template container class for managing the common
singly-linked lists we use all over in the project. [Aaron Giles]

Replaced "const address_space" with "address_space" throughout the
system. The purpose of making it const before was to discourage direct
tampering, but private/protected does a better job of that anyhow,
and it is annoying now. [Aaron Giles]

neodrvr.c updates: [Johnboy]
 * Renamed the following sets: sengokh -> sengokuh, fatfursa ->
    fatfurspa, shocktra -> shocktroa kof99 -> kof99h, kof99a -> kof99
 * Removed wh2j (only diff. C-ROM arrangement; same data)
 * Added correct m1 to sengoku3
 * Corrected ROM_REGION "maincpu" for . twinspri, ghostlop, aof2,
    aof2a, fightfev, fightfeva
 * Added correct p1 ROM to irrmaze

Changed GP9001 (toaplan VDP device) to use DEVICE_SELF [David Haywood]

Added 3 Bags Full - 5VXFC790 (Victorian). Set is now parent. Replaced
the bad dumped GFX from NZ set with the new ones, since they match 4
of 6 bitplanes. [Roberto Fresca]

Improvements to calomega.c driver [Roberto Fresca]
 * Added Game 24.0 (Gaming Draw Poker, hold). The game is playable.
 * Added missing 50/60Hz output frequency selector to systems 903-905.
    However, I dunno how it looks physically (switch/jumper/bridge?)
 * Injected missing start and NMI vectors to comg080 (Arcade Black
    Jack), from an exhaustive program ROM analysis / reverse
    engineering. The game now starts ok and is triggering proper
    NMI's.
 * Inputs from the scratch for comg080 (Arcade Black Jack).
 * Added workaround to pass the vector-check protection.
 * Reworked the lamps circuitry by system-basis.
 * Updated games list and technical notes.
 * Promoted comg080 (Arcade Black Jack) to working state.
 * Added support for system 906III:
 * Accurate memory map, CRTC, and PIAs mapped.
 * Preliminary PIAs support (no multiplexion yet).
 * Added proper machine driver, with correct R65C02 CPU.
 * Documented the hardware specs.
 * Added Game 51.08 (CEI Video Poker, Jacks or Better), running in CEI
    906III hardware. The game is not working.

Various sm8500 CPU core fixes [Robbbert]

Improvements to CEI 906 III system. [Roberto Fresca]
 * Corrected docs about the 906III memory map.
 * Mapped the AY8912.
 * Added AY8912 proper interfase. Tied SW2 to AY8912 port.
 * PIA0, portA is polled constantly. Tied some debug handlers to
    understand how the input system works.
 * Added notes about the PIAs R/W.

Clear Z80 DART interrupts at constructor time. [Curt Coder]

Imported the Hitachi HCD62121 CPU core from MESS. [Curt Coder]

crospang, heuksun, bestri (crospang.c) [stephh] :
 * Improved Dip Switches (after verification of the M68000 code)

Expanded the Z80-DART interface to allow future implementation of
Z80-SIO features: [Curt Coder]
 * added separate clock inputs for channel B
 * added SYNC inputs/outputs for both channels

Toaplan2: Attempted to implement dual VDP mixing with the equations
provided by Quench, doesn't yet work [David Haywood]

added correct GFX roms for Gang Wars, renamed bootleg set as Euro set
(and new parent),made note about bootleg GFX roms [David Raingeard]

Documented unemulated protection in Super Champion Baseball, marked
the game with GAME_UNEMULATED_PROTECTION due of that [Angelo Salese]

segaic16.c: Treat unsupported read and write accesses to defined
devices/memory as open-bus reads or unmapped writes instead of falling
through to the memory-mapping registers [Phil Bennett]

Added mask-free versions of read_word/read_dword/read_qword to
address_space. Also added unaligned variants that can read unaligned
values. Rewrote the core handler as a template that handles all cases,
along with a simple unit test to verify that everything is correct.
[Aaron Giles]

Updated 68k, v60, i86, and nec cores to use unaligned read/ write
instead of their own stubs for handling misalinged reads. 
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed memory management of ga2 decryption. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed Toaplan2 VDP mixing in Batsugun [David Haywood]

Toaplan2: Removed tile limit hack, not needed now since VDP is mixed
properly [David Haywood]

Correct the rom labels for the atari version of Arabian
[The Dumping Union]

Cleaned up internal profiler code. [Aaron Giles]

All American Football set updates: [Phil Bennett]
 * aafb: Added missing 03-28008.u93 GFX ROM
 * aafbb: Marked 24015-02.u59 BAD_DUMP and demoted set to
    GAME_NOT_WORKING

Declared virtual functions in driver_data_t for:
 * machine_start, machine_reset
 * sound_start, sound_reset
 * palette_init, video_start, video_reset, video_update, video_eof
The default implementations of these call through the machine
configuration's functions as before. However, if a driver_data_t
overrides them, it will be called instead. [Aaron Giles]

Also added virtual functions for pre_save() and post_load(), which can
be overridden to implement machine driver-specific pre-save/post-load
functionality instead of registering with the save state system.
[Aaron Giles]

Updated beathead to use these new virtual functions instead of
specifying callbacks in the MACHINE_DRIVER. [Aaron Giles]

CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]:
 * Added proper willowj roms to match real pcb, it was using incorrect
    roms copied from parent set
 * Added an old pcb rev of knightsj, using split roms

 * Minor cleanups and fixes

fastlane (fastlane.c) [stephh] :
 * Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the HD6309
    code)

theoretically work as current ertictac.c emulation (not yet enabled)
[Angelo Salese]

firetrap, firetrapj, firetrapbl (firetrap.c) [stephh] :
 * Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the Z80 code)
 * Fixed coin insertion which now correctly supports "Coin A" and
    "Coin B" settings
 * Fixed MCU simulation for 'firetrapj' (only the initialisation was
    different) so the game is now playable

[Fabio Priuli]

karnov, karnovj, wndrplnt, chelnov, chelnovu, chelnovj (karnov.c)
[stephh] :
 * Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the M68000
    code)

naomi.c: Added information about the Namco MASK B-F2X cartridge
[f205v]

Improved sound in Erotictac / Poizone [Angelo Salese, Phil Bennett]

De-converted MACHINE_DRIVER from tokens back to constructor functions,
regaining type safety. If legacy devices still use inline data, those
types are not checked. However, new devices no longer have access to
the generic m_inline_data. Instead their MDRV_* macros should map to
calls to static functions in the device config class which downcast a
generic device_config to the specific device config, and then set the
appropriate values. This is not to be done inline in order to prevent
further code bloat in the constructors. See
eeprom/7474/i2cmem/okim6295 for examples. [Aaron Giles]

Updated the i8237 DMA device to no longer be legacy. [Harmony]

Updated the 8255 PPI device to no longer be legacy. [Harmony]

 * Updated the ram size to 128 megabytes
 * Added some SMBus handling, to let the bios run
 * Added placeholders for a few devices on the PCI bus
 * Added the "jamdis StartAddress,Length" command to the debugger that
lets you disassemble the "jam table" instructions used by the bios to
do some basic hardware initialization.

Updated the i8257 DMA device to no longer be legacy. [Harmony]

Updated the Dallas DS1302 RTC device to no longer be legacy. [Harmony]

pachifev (pachifev.c) [stephh] :
 * Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the TMS9995
    code)

Updated the Dallas DS2404 RTC device to no longer be legacy. [Harmony]

MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
- 03969: [Crash/Freeze] All sets and drivers using OKI audio: 
         Eventual crash using Save States (Aaron Giles)
- 03981: [Crash/Freeze] bosco, xevious and clones: Game reboots or 
         hangs (Alex Jackson)
- 03977: [Graphics] tceptor2: Graphics are incorrect, the top and 
         bottom roads are displayed with grids and it looks like 
         there should be 4 instead of 2. (Phil Bennett)
- 03964: [Documentation] shangonro: Year is wrong (Smitdogg)



Source Changes
--------------
raiden2.c: Add missing "VOICE2" sample rom to Raiden 2 sets where it
was missing.  Corrected rom names for MASK roms soldered to the PCB.
[Brian Troha]

Southern Systems Joker Poker: Added missing CPU IO map to the machine
driver. This allow boot the game and enter into the attract mode.
[Roberto Fresca]

Mini Boy 7 improvements: [Roberto Fresca]
 * Added a new complete set. Now set as parent.
 * Corrected Xtal frequency.
 * Mapped the PIA MC6821 (not wired since is not totally understood).
 * Preliminary attempt to decode the color PROM.
 * Mapped the AY-3-8910, but still needs ports and some checks.
 * Added debug and technical notes.

New driver for Mega Double Poker, from Blitz System Inc.
[Roberto Fresca]
 * Initial release.
 * Preliminary memory map.
 * Hooked both PIAs, but need more analysis to confirm the offsets.
 * Accurate graphics and color decode.
 * Added main PCB and daughterboard layouts.
 * Added partial docs and diagrams about the CPU/MCU/ROMs addressing.
 * Added debug and technical notes.

Added Magic Train, from Subsino. Since it's driven by a HD647180X0CP6
(Subsino - SS9600) plus SS9601 and SS9602 (for video and I/O
respectively), it's possible that needs to be moved to a new driver in
a near future. Also added technical notes. [Roberto Fresca]

mpu4drvr.c: Fixed mid-screen palette updates [David Haywood]

segas16b.c: Documented the Sega game ID for the Heavyweight Champ rom
board as well as corrected the rom names. [Brian Troha]

Return to type safety. Changed address maps back into functions that
build up the definition, rather than the whole tokenizing system,
which lost type checking. Added a new module addrmap.c which
implements the address map classes, and changed the macros to call
methods on the address_map and address_map_entry classes which are
strongly typed. Fixed a few incorrectly specified memory map entries 
along the way in twincobr.c, lordgun.c, galaxold.c. [Aaron Giles]

More API cleanup: [Aaron Giles]
 * removed cputag_clocks_to_attotime() and cputag_attotime_to_clocks()
    in favor of just expanding the class
 * same for cputag_suspend() and cputag_resume()

Fix crash when exiting the debugger if breakpoints are set. 
[Aaron Giles]

The dsp561xx CPU core now generates accurate disassembly for Konami
Polygonet hardware (verified against Motorola's reference
disassembler). [Andrew Gardner, Stiletto]

Fixed image device error handling [ShimaPong, Miodrag Milanovic]

Defined new class driver_data_t, which all driver_data classes must
derive from. Updated all class definitions to inherit from the new
class, and to call it in the constructor. Also changed the alloc()
signature to return a driver_data_t pointer instead of a void *.
Renamed and hid machine->driver_data as machine->m_driver_data. Added
a new templatized method machine->driver_data<class> which returns a
properly downcast'ed version of the driver data. Updated all code
which looked like this:

  mydriver_state *state = (mydriver_state *)machine->driver_data;

to this:

  mydriver_state *state = machine->driver_data<mydriver_state>();

The new function does a downcast<> which in debug builds dynamically
verifies that you're actually casting to the right type. [Aaron Giles]

Changed atarigen_state to be a base class from which all the related
Atari drivers derive their state from. [Aaron Giles]

Removed global variables from gaelco, namco, and nile sound cores.
[Atari Ace]

Converted seta.c, seta2.c, and ssv.c to driver_data. [Atari Ace]

Updated SAA5050 to form 12x20 chars as noted in documentation.
Updated malzak driver to support SAA5050 changes. [Miodrag Milanovic]

taitotz: add HDD image for Battle Gear 2 (2.04J) [gtbb08, R. Belmont]

namcoic.c: Fixed incorrect road colours in tceptor2, finallap and
others [Phil Bennett]

Fixed road transparency in Thunder Ceptor [Phil Bennett]

Fixed Z80 SIO interrupts by clearing them at constructor time so Z80 
daisy chain works properly and doesn't stall on a non-existant IEO
