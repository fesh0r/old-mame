0.92
----

This release comes prior to some major changes to the sound system from Aaron.
Once Aaron has submitted his sound system changes 0.93 will be released to
allow for easy testing of them.

----

Fixed most of the remaining issues with Taito F3 sound [Nicola Salmoria]
	Sound in Ring Rage and Riding Fight still doesn't work
	Quiz Theater has a bad sound rom
	Bust-A-Move Again (US) sound roms need checking again real (non
	-conversion) cart.
	
Improvements in the Microprose 3D driver [Philip J Bennett]
	games not playable, but still a big improvement over the skeleton
	driver
	
Improvements to MACs driver [Tomasz Slanina]
	now using ST0016 Video, however emulation is still incomplete so
	it doesn't do much more yet
	
Improvements to Hyperstone based drivers [Tomasz Slanina]

Added missing PROMs to many drivers [HIGHWAYMAN]

Fixed Vs. Goonies Dips [chaneman]

Lethal Enforcers Improvements [R.Belmont]
	Fixes:
	- Tilemap colors
	- Guns hooked up and aligned properly
	- Tilemap and sprite layers aligned with the guns
	- Various other cleanups - added a sprite ROM that was missing previously

	To do:
	- Figure out the correct sprite decode
	- Sprite/tilemap priorities
	- "Reload" indicator is funky, probably needs tilemap
	flip bits.
	- Fix K056832 external linescroll RAM support (used
	for high scores, parallax in scrolling stages)

Misc Changes [Nathan Woods]
	src/cpu/g65816/g65816.h:
	src/cpu/g65816/g65816.c:
	src/cpu/g65816/g65816op.h:
	src/cpu/g65816/g65816cm.h:
	    - Added a hook that allows a driver to install a custom read handler 
	for reading interrupt vectors (the 65816 has a signal that is asserted 
	when reading a vector and certain hardware needs to reroute the read)

	src/memory.c:
	src/memory.h:
	    - Created a memory_get_op_ptr() call.  This call is equivalent to 
	memory_get_read_ptr() in ADDRESS_SPACE_PROGRAM with the exception that it is 
	aware of the opbase handler. 

	src/debug/debugcmd.c:
	src/debug/debugvw.c:
	   - Modified debugger to use memory_get_op_ptr() to determine if opcode 
	memory is unmapped. 
		
Misc compiler fixes [Lawrence Gold]

Taito SJ update [Nicola Salmoria]
	- added sound CPU -> main CPU communication (fixes Tin Star hangs without 
	need for a kludge, and makes tunes between levels correctly play until the 
	end)
	- added memory map derived from schematics
	- added DAC volume control (I hear little difference, even if it's used).
	- coin lockout (important otherwise games could accept more than 9 coins)

Correct Hyperstone Iram mirroring [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added real noise generator to TMS5110 [Jarek Burczynski]

Workaround for Dipswitch problem in Mr Do's Castle [Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed bug in M37710 cpu core [R.Belmont]

More Sega improvements, including lots of set renaming and cleaning up of drivers
by removing unused code [Aaron Giles]

Updated some mahjong drivers to use the new standard inputs [James Wallace]
	note, there was a further submission, this will need resyncing and
	resubmitting
	
PSX based driver improvments [smf]
	- new board notes from Guru
	- removed 8.3 restrictions on namco system 11 rom names
	- improved root counter emulation
	- improved dma acknowledge emulation
	- changes visible area immediately instead of during video update

hooked up sound cpu in fitfight.c [Tomasz Slanina]

Misc compiler fixes for VC [Bryan McPhail]

Sound in Minesweeper driver [Frank Palazzolo]

... and probably a whole bunch of other bits and pieces I've forgotten to mention
 (the WIP updates might give a better overview)
 
Anything that is missing will probably need resubmitting after Aaron's changes.

Main purpose of this update is to clean up the compile warnings

--

Warning Cleanups [Nathan Woods, David Haywood]

ST-V update [Angelo Salese]
	-Added a kludge for Astra Super Stars to let it run past a nasty code,
	  nasty because I highly suspect it's a sh-2 bug,will be worked out in
	  the future.
	-Added some new vdp2 registers,for example the DISP one for avoid
	 transitions draws.
	-Re-added the layer disable/enable code that I sent in the past which
	 was lost,and removed the possibility to disable layers with non-debug
	 builds
	-Started to add default eeproms for the various games,for now I've hooked
	 up the one in Shienryu to let it run already with Vertical Switch.
	-Added the dynamic clocks,hopefully now 100% working.

TNZS driver update [Nicola Salmoria]
	- fixed crash due to code execution across bank cboundary (tnzs36b16yel)
	- removed kludges which were required to run Arkanoid 2 (they were just 
	mirror addresses)
	- added sprite banking (same as seta.c). Insecotr X and other were obvoisly 
	running at 30fps before, now they are ok. Also fixes insectx13b16gre and 
	insectx236b16gre.
	- added sprite buffering (not quite the same as seta.c). Fixes kabukiz 
	sprites and backgrounds, though there might still be a few glitches.
	- fixed kabukiz sound

Correct NeoGeo Mirroring + additional information on coin counters etc. [Razoola]

Lethal Enforcers updates [Nicola Salmoria, R.Belmont]

uPD7759 rewrite, fixing sound in System 16 games [Aaron Giles]

Small jalmah.c update to fix a crash [Angelo Salese]

0.91u1
------

This has been released quickly after 0.91 due to a bug left in the Memory System.
I consider core bugs critical and prefer to see them fixed in official updates as
soon as possible.

Compiler Warning fixes for non-GCC compiles [Bryan McPhail]
	cpuintrf.h			- Duplicate enum
	cpu/mh68hc11/hc11ops.c		- C99 variable fix & warning fix
	sound/streams.c			- C99 variable fix
	vidhrdw/pacman.c		- C99 variable fix
	vidhrdw/model3.c		- C99 variable fix, unused variable fix
					- macro redefinition fix
	vidhrdw/namcona1.c		- Fixed unused variable warning
	vidhrdw/taitoic.c		- Fixed unused variable warning
	vidhrdw/wgp.c			- Fixed unused variable warning
	windows/debugwin.c		- Missing #include

More compiler fixes [Lawrence Gold]
	src/cpu/arm7/arm7core.h
	src/cpu/powerpc/ppc.h
		Trailing comma at the end of an enum.
	
	src/cpu/mc68hc11/hc11ops.c
	src/cpu/mc68hc11/mc68hc11.c
		ANSI C89 unfortunately doesn't allow unnamed structs or unions, so I 
		had to uglify this code a bit.  A cleaner solution is welcome.
	
	src/drivers/segaorun.c
		Returning a value from a void function

Even more compiler fixes [Lawrence Gold]

Fixed SFTM on 64-bit builds/systems [R.Belmont]

Changes to Lethal Enforces [R.Belmont]
	- Implemented 48xx bankswitch region, which can toggle between custom chip
	  registers and RAM (evil!).
	- Removed hack to pass POST since we now do it the right way
	- Corrected 56832 RAM interface, added preliminary support for external
	  linescroll RAM on the 56832.  This helps with the garbage tilemaps a bit
	  since linescroll data is no longer getting sprayed all over VRAM.
	  
	  (note, with this update the driver was just crashing when I tested it,
	   so maybe something is wrong)

NEC disassembler update [Bryan McPhail]
	Added support for encrypted opcodes in i386 disassembler (for Irem games).
	Added some of the NEC V series instructions into i386 disassembler

Fixed bug in memory system introduced in 0.91, this was breaking at least Kinst,
the Seattle driver, and wwally. [Aaron Giles]

Qix driver update [Nicola Salmoria]
	- fixed hang in Electric Yo-Yo attract (elecyoyo055yel)
	- external volume control and stereo support [Derrick Renaud]
	- decrypted kram3, which is now working, unfortunately using large tables.
	
Fixed missing net in Super Vollyball (svolley37b12yel) [David Haywood]

Fixed garbage around life-bars in rabiolep (rabiolep37b1gre) [David Haywood]

Fixed? blanking out of levels at certain scores in Solomons Key (solomon36b10yel)
This appears to be some basic protection, needs further investigation [David Haywood] 

Fixed Zero Zone background banking [David Haywood]
