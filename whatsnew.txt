0.72

FAQ about new drivers added since 0.71
--------------------------------------

for Run and Gun you must hold down F2 and press F3 to init the Eeprom otherwise
the game won't boot, the rungunu set doesn't work correctly.

Megatech / Megaplay / NSS are preliminary, since the menu system doesn't yet work
perfectly on Megatech I've marked all the games as non-working, Megaplay still
doesn't boot so those are marked as Non-working, and the NSS menu isn't emulated
at all yet so I also consider that to be Non-working, I've enabled these anyway
as it may encourage others to help with the development, Mame is NOT turning into
an emulator for Consoles, these are Arcade systems much like PlayChoice-10.

Outrunners is currently still broken due to problems with the V60 and recent timer
updates, sorry.

The games using the sp0250 sound for speech still need samples for the sound
effects, however samples for the speech are no longer needed with this update.
