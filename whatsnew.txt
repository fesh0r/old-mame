Improved Lightgun Code / Reload Handling [Bryan McPhail]
	'-lightgun' now enables the lightgun only - no button remapping is performed.
	'-reload' (formally '-offscreen_reload') is now needed for 2nd button presses
           to map to offscreen shots.
	'-dual' (formally '-dual_lightgun') adds support for the Actlabs Dual Lightgun
           setup, it may be used with and without '-reload' and it requires '-lightgun'. 
           This mode attempts to automatically remap the player 1 & 2 buttons to suit the
           lightgun setup.  If it doesn't work you probably need to delete the .cfg file
           for that game.

YMF271 sound core plus very preliminary hook up in ms32.c (only Desert War makes
