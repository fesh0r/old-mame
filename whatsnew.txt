uicrash0108u5red [Nicola Salmoria]



Source Changes
--------------
Fixed subtle bug in the UI menu handler that only manifested on
mingw-based compiles. [Nicola Salmoria]

Updated CHD locating behavior to accept CHDs referenced by the 
parent of a clone if the hash matches, even if it has a different
name. [smf]

Improved flash emulation and added support for Fujitsu flash chips.
Switches Konami games over to new flash chips. [smf]

Improved behavior of SCSI CD implementation for audio playback and
TOC reading commands. [R. Belmont]

Fixed priorities and the offset of layer 3 in fcrash. [robiza]

Added save state support to the COP4xx core. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the new disassembler and override callback prototypes to
take const parameters and to remove the generally unused 'bytes'
parameter. The disassemblers can now assume that the buffers contain
enough bytes to hold the maximum instruction length as returned by
the CPU core get_info callback. [Aaron Giles]

Converted the following disassemblers to the new format, and added
step in/out support where it was obvious: adsp21xx, alph8201, 
arm, arm7, asap, ccpu, cdp1802, cop4x0, dsp32c, e132xs, g65816, 
h6280, h83002, i8x41, i960, i8051, i8085, jaguar, m680x, m6805, 
m37710, mc68hc11, pic16c5x, rsp, s2650, se3208, sh2, sharc, t11,
tms32010, tms32025, tms32031, tms34010, upd7810, v60, v810, z180,
and z8000. [Aaron Giles]

Deprecated the old disassembler interfaces in favor of the new ones.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed subtle bug in subtable allocation in the memory system that
caused the Eolith games to assert with the debugger. [Aaron Giles]

Tweaked the disassembly view to detect if the disassembly for the
current instruction has changed, and if so, recompute the entire 
view. This provides more dynamic updating when system states change
under certain CPUs. [Aaron Giles]

Added new symbol 'curpc' for all CPUs which represents the value of
the current instruction pointer, to avoid naming conflicts with the
'pc' register in other contexts. Changed this to be the default
value for the disassembly window in the Windows version of the
debugger (OSD ports will need to do likewise). [Aaron Giles]

Added a COP410 core to the COP4xx collection. [Nathan Woods]

Improved banking in the alpha68k games. [robiza]

Fixed memory leak when writing MNG files. [Buddabing]

Fixed several audit bugs introduced with the rewrite. [Mamesick]

Fixed lamps in funworld/cardline drivers. [wolf676]

Normalized realtime clock accesses across drivers. Now ensure that
realtime clocks are reset when recording/saving INP files.
[Nathan Woods]

Updated documentation in pacman driver to reflect actual sync chain.
Fixed sound frequencies for 2650 conversions. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug in displaying disassembly of CPUs whose minimum instruction
size was larger than their data bus size. [Aaron Giles]

Added new debugger command 'history' which dumps the most recent
instructions executed. [Aaron Giles]

Improvements to the Looping driver: [Aaron Giles]
 * fixed clock speeds
 * proper video timing
 * fixed protection (game would reset; should never have been marked
    'working' in the first place!)
 * various other driver cleanups

Cleaned up tms99xx core debugging and converted to new disassembler
syntax, adding step over/out support. [Aaron Giles]

Removed obsolete CPUINFO_PTR_REGISTER_LAYOUT and 
CPUINFO_PTR_WINDOW_LAYOUT data items. [Aaron Giles]

ftroption0109u2ora [Aaron Giles]



Source Changes
--------------
Added missing InitCommonControls(), which caused the debugger UI
to fail with recent updates. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed dip switches and added second player controls for beaminv
driver. [stephh]

Major rewrite of the SHARC core: [Ville Linde]
 - Bit-accurate reciprocals
 - More accurate pipeline emulation
 - Fixed the problems with operation latencies
 - Regression tested a few floating-point operations for bit-accurate 
    results
 - Improved DMA emulation
This update will fix most (but not all) of the clipping problems in 
Gradius 4 and NBA Play by Play.

Updated cardline driver lamps and layout: [wolf676]
 - converted hardcoded fake lamps to new artwork system
 - added button lamps card1-5, collect, bet, start
 - added simple button lamps artwork "cardline.lay".
 - re-ordered buttons and added "collect" button

Updated funworld driver lamps and layout: [wolf676]
 - added external credit in counter (mapped as coin 1 counter)
 - added external credit out counter (mapped as coin 8 counter)
 - added button lamps hold1-5, cancel, start
 - added simple button lamps artwork "funworld.lay".

Added COP420 core for the Altair games. [Curt Coder]

Increased the interleave in Xevious to fix synchronization issues.
[robiza]

Added new output control system. This system is designed to support
multiple output streams, and should replace all instances of printf
in the code. You can now call one of these functions:

  mame_printf_error
  mame_printf_warning
  mame_printf_info
  mame_printf_debug

to output data. By default, these go to the console, but they can be
overridden by the OSD layer to route wherever is appropriate.
[Aaron Giles]

Some additional Grand Champion cleanup. [Aaron Giles]

IMPORTANT NOTE TO OSD DEVELOPERS: As of this release, you are now
required to make use of options.c to set core options. At a minimum,
this requires calling options_init(NULL) before calling run_game().

Source Changes
--------------
Improved DIP switches in the yunsun16 driver and added more
documentation. [stephh]

Improved timer accuracy and added save state support to the 
6526 CIA module. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed bug in memory map dumping code that caused wrong addresses
to be dumped. [Wilbert Pol]

Connected TMS5220 speech support to the Major Havoc: Return to Vax
mod. [Jess Askey]

Changed comment shortcut in disassembly windows to avoid clash with
Ctrl+C for "Copy". [Nathan Woods]

Added checking for register symbol names to ensure they aren't
numeric (which prevents their identification by the expression
parser). Changed the M4510 CPU symbols to avoid tripping this
check. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed crash in the Win32 debugger code with small window sizes.
[Samuele Zannoli]

Fixed assertion when auditing systems with no samples or ROMs.
[Nathan Woods]

Some pmpoker driver improvements: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Added service/settings mode to pmpoker.
 - Added PORT_IMPULSE to manage correct timings for most inputs 
    in all games.

Fixed "run to cursor" functionality for CPUs that had an address
bus shift. [Andrew Gardner]

Fixed bug that caused false positive ZIP filename matches.
[Aaron Giles]

Added PATH_SEPARATOR define so that platforms with non forward-slash
path separators can get preassembled paths in their native format.
[Aaron Giles]

Some enhancements to the options manager: [Aaron Giles]
 * added a simpler options_init for startup
 * added support for internal options
 * added support for multiple unadorned options
 * moved core options definitions into the core options.c
    (note that the default INI path no longer includes $HOME/.mame
     since that is not cross-platform; *nix platforms will need to
     explicitly override that default in their OSD code)
 * added accessor to set the default value of a given option
 * changed error reporting so that errors are tracked internally
    and reported only once

Improved documentation in osdepend.h to better describe some of the
functions and provide a general overview of how things work. Removed 
unused osd_readkey_unicode function. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug in the bilinear software scaler that would read out of
bounds on a bitmap. [Aaron Giles]

Added supervisor DAC support to the Max-a-Flex driver. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed clock speeds on Turbo/Buck Rogers. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed -romident with ZIP files. [Aaron Giles]

IMPORTANT NOTE TO OSD DEVELOPERS: The file I/O interface has changed
significantly. It is now much simpler. Please read osdepend.h for
full details on how the new OSD-defined functions work. In addition,
you must now use the options.c to specify your search paths. If you
are parsing standard command line options and INI files, this work
is relatively straightforward. Otherwise, you can manually call
options_set_string() for each of the search paths to configure them
from whatever options store you are using.

Source Changes
--------------
More findout.c/getrivia.c improvements: [wolf676]
 - added ticket dispenser to Trivia/Sexual Trivia
 - found last unknown dipswitch in Selection/Poker
 - added missing "Payout" button; payout hardware unknown 
 - added missing "Play / Raise" button and its lamp 9
 - added "Button 12 ?" to selection, function unknown
 - re-added PORT_IMPULSE(2) to poker games buttons because they do 
    not like it if two or more buttons are held; trivia games still 
    respond better without this
 - changed coin_lockout_global to coin_lockout_w(0) and 
    coin_lockout_w(1) for 2 coin slots in selection; 
 - added missing lamps 11 (coin slot 2), 12 and 13 (unknown) 
    to selection

Fixed crash in the MPU4 driver. [El Condor]

Hooked up ARM ROM for kovsh, though it doesn't work yet. [ElSemi]

Some fixes for the 8080bw driver: [Robert]
 - The correct samples are being used for lrescue, lrescuem, 
    grescue, desterth 
 - Dipswitch corrections for superinv, invadrmr, sinvemag, 
    spceking, spacewr3 
- Remove extraneous beeping noise from indianbt 

Converted all the toaplan2.c games to mono since the PCBs are JAMMA
without external stereo connectors. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Added bounds checking to the qsound driver. [David Haywood]

Redesigned the OSD file I/O interfaces to be simpler and more
straightforward. Also simplified the core's file I/O routines and
included some functionality that was previously left to the OSD
layer. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote unzip.c to return richer errors and generally behave better.
[Aaron Giles]

Rewrote audit.c to simplify the code and not rely on extraneous
functions that were in the old file I/O system. [Aaron Giles]

Simplified the 68000 core generation logic to just produce one
file. Hopefully this will cure some of the build issues with the
core. [Aaron Giles]
