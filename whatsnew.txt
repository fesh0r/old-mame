Large Namco Update [Nicola Salmoria]
- pacland: fixed sprite RAM, it was too big and included normal program RAM, causing sprites
  to be drawn twice.
- pacland: fixed irq enable
- pacland: fixed tilemap scroll offsets and sprite positions
- pacland: accurate emulation of tile/sprite priority (including fix of bugs introduced when
  the driver was converted to tilemaps) and sprite visibility area
- pacland36b16 is not a bug - colors match the real game
- added SOUND_NAMCO_CUS30 for better documentation (alias for the standard SOUND_NAMCO)
- drgnbstr36rc2gre
- skykidd works with a patch (a dump of the CUS60A internal ROM is needed to do without the
  patch)
- metrocross: fixed irq enable, this fixes inputs in service mode
- baraduke060gre
- baraduke36rc2gre, it is improved, there are still gaps left but this is correct behaviour
  verified on the real board
- baraduke, system86: understood how sprite RAM buffering works, this fixes sprite lag but
  causes a glitch in rthunder (which might be correct behaviour)
- system86: totally rewritten the 63701X emulation and moved it to a separate module.  Fixed 
  silence compression, this improves quality in some samples; supported volume control.
  -genpeitd067gre
- rthundro37b14red I think is fixed; but the game still sometimes crashes when you die
- rthunder, genpetid: fixed watchdog emulation, this allows entering service mode without
  resetting

Discrete Sound Updates [Derrick Renaud]

Discrete Sound Changes
======================
* fixed/added more documentation of functions at top of discrete.h
* DISCRETE_555_ASTABLE - changed to use common options with DISCRETE_555_CC.
* DISCRETE_TRANSFORMx - fixed bug that preformed math in the wrong order.
Also added more math functions.

New Discrete Modules Added
==========================
* DISCRETE_555_CC - Constant Current based 555 VCO with 8 main configurations,
that automatically configure from components used.
* DISCRETE_566 - NE566 simulation.
* DISCRETE_COMP_ADDER - Multiple parallel capacitor/resistor circuit.
* DISCRETE_DAC_R1 - R1 Ladder DAC that automatically configures from
components used.
* DISCRETE_MIXERx - Resistor/Op Amp mixer stage with filtering that calulates
proper gains & filtering. It automatically configure from components used.
* DISCRETE_SCHMITT_OSCILLATOR - VCO based on a Schmitt Inverter.

Game Driver Changes
===================

Timer System Update [Aaron Giles]

The timer system is now integer-based instead of floating-point based. It requires
64-bit ints. I've defined a new type 'mame_time' which is a 96-bit time value.
There are 32 bits for counting full seconds, and 64 bits for counting subseconds.
This type is used extensively in the core timer system and the CPU scheduler.

The accuracy of the new system is down to 1 attosecond (10^-18 seconds).
This may seem excessive, but for a 100MHz CPU, each clock cycle is 10^10
attoseconds. That works nicely because 100MHz divides evenly. For a 96MHz
CPU, each clock cycle is 1.041666667 * 10^10 attoseconds. Rounding, we lose
1/3 of an attosecond per cycle in error. Multiply that error by 96000000 and
you end up with an error of 32000000 attoseconds. Fortunately, that's only
0.032ns, but if I had much less accuracy than this, the errors would start
to add up in a more significant way.

All the existing APIs are still around, and doubles can still be passed as
arguments. But they are all immediately connverted to 'mame_time' values for
processing.

The old system had some drifting errors due to FP rounding which are gone
now.



Fixed Unix compile (renamed rand_r in namconb1 driver) [R.Belmont]

Misc Fixes [Nathan Woods]

	src/cpuintrf.h:
	    - Fixups for the CP1610 core
	    - Fixed the declaration of activecpu_set_irq_callback()

	      CPU cores

	src/includes/snes.c:
	    - Refactored to remove MESS specific code

	src/machine/idectrl.c:
	src/machine/idectrl.h:
	    - Added ide_bus_0_r() call to access the bus directly

	src/cpu/z80/z80.c:
	    - This patch changes the Z80 CPU core to set the Z80 cycle tables to 
  	      their defaults on startup.  This removes any need for drivers to reset 
	      the Z80 cycle tables back to their defaults on exit.

General Source Changes

Big 80s Namco Update [Nicola Salmoria]

this affects the first Namco games that used custom I/O chips.
- these files are no longer needed and should be removed: drivers/bosco.c,
  drivers/xevious.c, drivers/digdug.c, machine/digdug.c, machine/galaga.c,
  machine/bosco.c, machine/polepos.c, sndhrdw/bosco.c
- added three new sound chips: NAMCO_15XX, NAMCO_52XX, NAMCO_54XX, and
  changed drivers to use them (NAMCO_54XX is just a placeholder playing
  samples, until the chip is reverse engineered).
- MAME testers bugs fixed: digdug063gre, galaga057gre, bosco071u2gre,
  poleposc059gra
- added EAROM support to digdug
- fixed the polepos2 title screen which had been broken since day 1, strange
  that nobody noticed.
- fixed various mistakes in the polepos ROM loading (one missing speech ROM
  in polepos,  polepos2 was using the wrong engine sound ROMs (it's turbo!),
  added missing vertical scaling PROMs).
- extensive documentation of ROM names and placement, and differences
  between Namco and licensed versions.
- converted all drivers to tilemaps, and made gfx emulation more accurate
  according to schematics
- polepos sprite zooming should now be closer to the hardware.
- IP_KEY_PREVIOUS and IP_JOY_PREVIOUS are no longer used by any driver: they
  may be removed from the core.
- support for start lamps, coin counters and coin lockout (all
  internallyhandled by the custom I/O chip)
- toggling the test switch while the game is running enters test mode
  without need to manually reset.
- found and documented test mode Easter eggs in all games except Xevious.
- bosconian now uses a different sound PROM, which seems more correct.
- galaga uses better dumps of the PROMs, with the unused top 4 bits set to
  0.
- correct handling of 52XX sample start/end pointers in ROM.
- better emulation of 50XX custom, no more need for hacks in bosconian.
- swapped digdug and digdugb, the main set should be the newer one.
- removed these galaga clones: nebulbee (copyright/name change), galagab2
  (mix 'n match of ROMs from other sets), galaga84 (copyright/gfx change),
  galagads (1-byte hack to get fast shoot,
  reproducible with this line in cheat.dat:
  galaga:1:070D:0D:100:Fast Shoot)
- added Galaga rev. B, which is now the main set, renamed the other galagao.
- added galagamk, a different Midway version.
- removed various bad dumps from polepos2b and poleps2c, they turned out to
  be the same version so poleps2c is removed.
- drivers/locomotn.c is no longer needed and should be removed
- converted to tilemaps, consolidated as much as I could
- fixed: jungler37b3gre
- correct tile/sprite priority handling (also in Bosconian)
- documented the Easter egg in Rally X
- added starfield in Tactician
- fixed the RC filter control in the games with Konami sound

Big Namco NB1 update [Phil Stroffolino]
Various improvements for System NB emulation, including:
- new driver: Greatest Slugger '93 (Japan)
- hardware shadow support (used heavily in Greatest Slugger)
- dedicated random number generator chip
- sprite stretch glitch (affects Outfoxies intro)
- tilemap tile banking feature (used by Mach Breakers)
- removed several game-specific hacks; now uses dedicated CPU registers
  for interrupts
- preliminary support for screen blanking (hides garbage in Outfoxies)
- proper POSIRQ handling, for scanline effects.  Fixes the water
  effects in Outfoxies.  This same feature needs to be folded into System
  2 emulation, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.
- various Mach Breaker-specific hacks for interpretting the ROZ layer
  registers; these aren't yet fully understood.  In particular, the
  "Monster Pull" stage is missing a "3d floor."

  Changes should fix mametesters bugs:
  machbrkr068gre, nebulray066gre, ptblank056gre, sws9637b16yel
