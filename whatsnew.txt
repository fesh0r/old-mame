------

General Source Changes
----------------------

386 updates [Nathan Woods]
	src/cpu/i386/i386.c:
	    - Implemented usage of segment limits (or whatever they are called)
	    - Implemented 16-bit interrupts
	    - Initial values of IDTR are now properly specified
	    - i386_interrupt() is no longer called when i386_set_irq_line() is 
	called with a state of zero
	    - Actual cycle count is now returned
	
	src/cpu/i386/i386op16.c:
	    - Partially implemented far CALL and JMP instruction

	src/cpu/i386/i386ops.c:
	    - Implemented PUSH rm8 instruction

i960 cpu core / disassembler [Olivier Galibert, R.Belmont, Farfetch'd]

SPI Improvements [Ville Linde]
	SPI:
	- The "old" video hardware (viperp1) does have 3
	layers after all, but no rowscroll.  Fixed.
 
	386:
	- Bugfixed Nathan's REP

Fixed YMF271 pitch [Ville Linde]
	improves music in Brave Blade
	
Fixed small fileio problem [Nathan Woods]

386 updates [Nathan Woods]
	-  Added a distinction between maskable and non maskable interrupts 
	(like int 3, illegal instruction etc)
	-  Added a distinction between invalid and unimplemented instructions.  
	Invalid instructions raise an interrupt, and unimplemented instructions 
	call osd_die() for now
	-  i386_set_irq_line() will no longer raise an interrupt when passed 
	with state=0
	-  Various string intructions now use SI/DI instead of ESI/EDI when in 
	16-bit mode
	-  Implemented LOCK and RETF
	-  Fixed a bug in LMSW
	-  Minor disassembler fixes

Improved PSX sio [smf]

Various DIP fixes [Brian Troha]
	Gold Medalist (alpha68k.c)
	Break Through (brkthru.c)
	Got-Ya (gotya.c)
	American Horseshoes & Plotting (taito_l.c)
	
Phil's 'if I get hit by a bus' Namco S22 MLE update [Phil Stroffolino]

	TMS32025:
	bugfix for lst and lst1 opcodes; the "ignore ARP" hack has been replaced with a better hack, that doesn't interfere with indirect addressing.

	Preliminary serial I/O support has been added, to update DRR/DXR on RINT and XINT interrupts.  set_irq_line() no longer masks the lines with 0x7; this allows external triggering of RINT/XINT interrupts.

	System22 driver changes:

	- display list processing is now done by the master DSP
	- the slave DSP's in-game graphics processing and "custom render devices" are currently simulated, which works only for Prop Cycle
	- support for PDP block-based memory transfers
	- support for DSP data/code uploads from main CPU
	- support for "Point RAM" and "Point ROM" access
	- most self tests are working in Prop Cycle and Ridge Racer (Japan)
	- prelim hand-crafted "internal ROMs" for master and slave DSP
	- various notes regarding DSP ports/addressing

	- Added the missing keys to E-Jan

	- Added 93C46 eeprom to RF2 single and RF2 2K. It's
	not hooked up though.

	to affect the SPI games, but should help with MESS

0.81u4
------

General Source Changes
----------------------

Hyperstone CPU core fixes [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
	- Added addressing of next byte if in load / store instructions using
	  Displacement Address Mode PC is used as register destination
	- Added local registers wrap around modulo 64
	- Added trap instructions to the dasm
	- Added some debug info when high global registers are written
	- Fixed some wrong format in the dasm
	- Changed reset to act as an exception, as the doc claims (before it crashed
	  if reset was used as an exception)

	  the egregious hack I had in there before
	* fixed sound reset and initialization
	* all diagnostics pass
	* fixed coinage dipswitches
	* added 2 alternate ROM sets for each game
	Fixes: kinst067gre2, kinst072gre

MIPS DRC fixes [Aaron Giles]
	Fixes an edge case where a memory access like:
	  lw  r3,$0(r0)
	would leave the stack in a funny state and lead to a crash.
	Fixes kinst067red.

	Instructions of the form:
	ld   r10,0(r10)
	Would load the low word into r10 first, and then use the modified r10 (plus
	4) as the address of the high word. Bad bad bad.
	Fixes the sky graphics in several of the kinst2 levels. 

ZN Improvements [smf]
	24-bit rendering support for Judge Dredd

Updates to the 'jalmah' driver [Angelo Salese]
	kakumei and kakumei2 now boot but neither are playable due to protection

Misc Updates [Nathan Woods]
	src/windows/windows.mak:
	- Fixes the afore mentioned problem with x86drc.c

	src/fileio.c:
	src/windows/fileio.c:
	- Adds in a new (windows only) mode for opening files whereby files 
	  can be opened for read/write, but changes are not actually not written 
	  to the original file but rather to a temporary file.  This trick is used 
	  by the MESS testing facility so that tests do not mutate the images they 
	  operate on.
	- Small cleanups

	src/png.c:
	- Replaces a #ifdef MESS/#else/#endif combo with a usage of the 
	  APPNAME macro

SPI / 386 updates [Ville Linde]
	* raidnfgt now runs normally and correctly through
	  attract mode and gameplay, modulo the encrypted
	  graphics.  Still kinda mesmerizing :-)
	* viperp1 starts to boot now, but doesn't get very far
	* Hooked up the Z80 bankswitching, so sound started
	  playing in some games (notably Raiden Fighters). (R.Belmont)

Various ST-V updates [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
	fixes sprites in groovef which is now playable, adds some RBG0 scrolling
	which greatly improves background graphics in cotton2, cottonbm, grdforce
	and othellos

Debugger Fixes [Aaron Giles]
	This is a quick attempt to make the debugger more useable with the new
	memory system. The masking of addresses and data should now be working
	properly again.

	Also, you can go to any memory window and type 'P' to view program address
	space, or 'T' to view data address space.

OSD 'NO EXECUTE' Support [Aaron Giles]
	This patch introduces two new OSD functions:

	osd_alloc_executable();
	osd_free_executable();

	For most platforms, these can just map to malloc and free. However, starting
	with WinXP SP2, if you are running on a processor that supports the
	NO_EXECUTE bit (currently only 64-bit AMD chips),
	standard user-mode memory allocations won't allow you to put code in them
	and execute it.

	Since this is exactly what x86drc.c does, I've added the two functions
	above. On Windows, these map to calling VirtualAlloc and VirtualFree, which
	allow you to specify the read/write/execute states of the pages thus
	allocated.

Lethal Justice / Egg Venture Cleanups [Aaron Giles]
	* merged memory maps
	* fixed video size in Egg Venture to correct flicker
	* switched to VIDEO_RGB_DIRECT
	* removed unnecessary ROM regions and memcpy'ing

Rockola Cleanups / Fixes [Curt Coder]
	* Fantasy/Nibbler/Pioneer Balloon
	drivers/rockola.c
	sndhrdw/rockola.c
	- Correct CPU frequency from schematics
	- Hooked up SN76477 sound for BOMB effect
	- Merged memory maps
	- Cleaned up driver a bit
	- Fixed dips
	- Enabled debug inputs
