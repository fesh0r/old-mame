Fixed tiny.mak for the changes from 0.103u5. [Derrick Renaud]

Fixed NVRAM handling in Star Wars/ESB (only affects test mode).
[Mathis Rosenhauer]

Decrypted the question ROMs in the coinmstr.c games. [Nicola Salmoria]

Updated djboy driver with more protection information.
[Phil Stroffolino]

More NeoGeo cleanups. [David Haywood]

Phoenix Discrete Sounds - Changed R22 to 470 ohm per real board. This 
should fix the remaining complaints with the discrete sound. The shot 
& explosion noise sounds still need discrete emulation.
[Derrick Renaud]

Added 16-segment drawing code to the vacfdisp module. [El Condor]

Made 8-bit A,B,C,D,E,H and L registers available in the Z80
debugger. [Nicola Salmoria, Aaron Giles]

Ensured that all core and windows files have some indication of
copyright on them. [Aaron Giles]

Shuffled a few more files around in mame.mak; rebuild clean once
again to ensure correctness. [Aaron Giles]

Removed all but the default debugger font from the source
distribution. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed miscomputed registers view size in debugger. [Aaron Giles]

esb065gre [Mathis Rosenhauer]



Source Changes
--------------
Undid fix for turbofrc37b1gre since it broke more things that it
fixed. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed minor color issue in Cookie & Bibi. [David Haywood]

Updates to the Hyperstone core: [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
 - Removed nested delays
 - Added better delay branch support
 - Fixed PC seen by a delay instruction, because a delay instruction
    should use the delayed PC (thus allowing the execution of 
    software opcodes too)

Hooked up watchdog for NeoGeo games and removed a number of hacks.
[David Haywood]

Fixed hanging at the end of level 3 in klondkp. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed inputs in Renju Kizoku, Neratte Chu, Mayjinsen 2 and some dips 
in Neratte Chu, Mayjinsen 2. [Sonikos]

Improved auto_malloc so it uses less memory and doesn't have a hard-
coded limit on the maximum number of allocations. Also audited the
use of auto_malloc in the code and removed unnecessary checks for
NULL (since auto_malloc doesn't return if it fails). [Atari Ace]

Fixed osd_fopen error reporting to return the correct value if you 
hit MAX_OPEN_FILES. [Nathan Woods]

Changed several byte operands in the i386 disassembler to be 
diassembled as unsigned rather than signed. [Nathan Woods]

Discrete sound updates: [Derrick Renaud]
 - Added new DISCRETE_CSVLOG module that lets you log discrete nodes 
    as CSV (comma separated values) data.
 - Modified discrete core to use the clock specified in the 
    MDRV_SOUND_ADD line.  If the clock is specified as 0, then the 
    discrete emulation will default to the audio sample rate clock.
 - Tweaked Phoenix Effect 2 sound to be more accurate matching 
    oscilliscope data.  Changed the Phoenix discrete clock rate to 
    a fixed rate of 120000 allowing the simulation to be more 
    accurate with less alaising noise at the cost of speed. 
 - Fixed the bug in the DISCRETE_NOTE module that produced notes 
    1 count off.

Added support for registers that are not to be displayed in the 
register list. This is useful for registers like AX on i386, so that
AX can be used in expressions but not represented on the register 
list. Simply precede the register name with '~' to prevent display.
[Nathan Woods, Aaron Giles]

Added support for the various x86 8-bit and 16-bit derived 
registers, as hidden registers in the i386 core. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed background music in ESB. Updated IRQ frequency and divider to 
match the schematics. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Improved dip switches for rocktrv2. [Chaneman]

Separated the allocation of graphics data from the decoding. This 
fixes the crashes that were introduced in u4, and will allow for 
decoding progress to be reported eventually. [Aaron Giles]

Made a clean-up pass over all the makefiles. rules.mak is gone now,
replaced by cpu.mak and sound.mak. mame.mak has been reorganized. All 
the makefiles are now commented and should be easier to follow. 
[Aaron Giles]

Rewrote artwork scaling function to compute accurate sum over all
contributing pixels. This produces better results when scaling high
resolution artwork down to lower resolutions. Kept existing bilinear
filter for scaling low resolution art to higher resolutions. 
[Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------
Intel i386/i486/Pentium update: [Nathan Woods]
 - Fixed A20 mask implementation
 - Added A20 mask to debugger translate callback
 - Implemented Pentium opcode CMPXCHG8B
 - Fixed XADD, and added support for the 8 and 16 bit variants

Fixed Top Shooter sprites. Game still not playable. [Tomasz Slanina]

Changed debug view property code to pass property values as unions 
rather than void pointers, in order to appease compilers that whine 
about strict aliasing. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed resource allocation issue with bitmaps in the Windows code and
MESS. [Nathan Woods]

Removed a number of unnecessary video_stop and machine_stop routines.
[Atari Ace]

Converted a few more exit() calls to osd_die(). [Oliver Stoneberg]

Fixed inputs on Ninja Spirit and the Sega System 16b driver to match 
the JAMMA button ordering. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Fixes to the Hyperstone core: [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
 - Removed nested delays
 - Don't allow software opcodes to be executed in a delay slot

Added/changed the following discrete modules: [Derrick Renaud]
 - DISCRETE_WAVELOG - easy way to log discrete nodes as a .wav file 
    to compare against scope waveforms.
 - DISCRETE_OUTPUT - added a final gain parameter to get it to 16 bit 
    wav level.  (The old VOL setting was disabled after the last 
    sound re-write.)

Fixed graphics banking in 8751-based Altered Beast sets. 
[David Haywood]

Fixed some bad gfx in kdynastg when levels start. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Decrypted graphics in Darkmist and Panic Road. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added stream_set_sample_rate() call, and converted the TMS5110, 
TMS5220, ES5505/6, BSMT2000, AY8910, POKEY, TIA, Sega PCM/Multi-PCM, 
SN76496, OKIM6295, and YMZ280B sound cores to output at their native 
sample rates, allowing the core sound system to perform over/
re-sampling to the output rate. [Aaron Giles]

Moved CHD file access routines to fileio.c. [Aaron Giles]

Added assert macro to mamecore.h. [Aaron Giles]

[Nathan Woods]

Improved sound balance in Night Slashers. [MAME Italia]

Improvements to the Deco MLC games (added sprite buffering, fixed

interrupt bug fix). The only thing left for this driver is really 
raster support for the pitch in Stadium Hero. [Bryan McPhail]

Fixed Hang On stereo sound routine. [Mamesick]

Cleaned up PC keyboard code. [Nathan Woods]

Added memory_install_* calls that are not specific to specific bus 
widths (only for static handlers, not for function pointers).

Converted Crazy Balloon sound to use the discrete system. 
[Derrick Renaud]

Major Namco System 22 update: [Phil Stroffolino]

    hacks as a result.
 * Hooked up the runtime-configurable interrupt handlers, removing 
    more game-specific hacks.
 * Some improvements and additional documentation of video hardware.

line. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed the handling of address masking and display within the debugger.
[Aaron Giles, Nathan Woods]

Fixed order of operations in the expression engine if functions were

Fixed sound bug in Phoenix sound effect #2 [Hans Andersson]

NeoGeo updates [http://neosource.1emulation.com/forums/]
 * Fatal Fury 2 - Emulated Protection
 * King of Fighters 10th Anniversary - Added code to update SRAM 
    tiles on the fly
 * CCTHD2k3 - Fixed GFX / Colours
 * Added code to support remaining NeoGeo sets

Fixed Mat Mania dipswitches [Roberto Fresca]

Fixed some Leap Year calculates [William Krick, smf]

Sync Refresh / Waitvsync / Triplebuffer changes [Alan Kamrowski II]
 * Changed the waitvsync code to wait for the beginning of the 
    vertical blank (the previous code simply checked if it was in the 
    vblank and only waited if it wasn't).
 * Removed the waitvsync only if game speed is above 95% restriction.
    This restriction would only cause waitvsync to vacillate between 
    on and off depending on game speed.
 * When syncrefresh and triplebuffer are used, MAME would run the 
    waitvsync code anyway. The triplebuffer code takes care of this 
    already.

Fixed typo in monzagp.c [Brad Oliver]

Documentation cleanups in ddenlovr.c [Brian Troha]

    attached to the DE156 chip.
 * Deco 32: Night Slashers pretty much perfect apart from lack of 
    sound.  
 * Deco 32: Some graphics fixes for Tattoo Assassins.
 * Deco 156: Heavy Smash pretty much perfect.
