#Hit "0" then "enter" on the keypad, to start the horses racing. That's the big thing to know.
#
#Before the race, multiple players can bid. Hit player number (1-6) then
#enter, type in bet amount then enter, then pick "W" or "E" -- I have no idea
#what that is, other than maybe Win or Place or Show? -- and then the color
#of the horse (listed at the bottom). Then start the race.
