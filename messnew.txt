System Driver Changes:
----------------------

  (Bug #95) [Ben Bruscella]

- [UK101/SUPERBOARD] Cassette Initialization fixed [Stefano Priore]

- [MBEE] Renamed mbeepc to mbeepc85. Now mbee emulates the IC model (editor
  assembler), mbeepc emulates the PC model (terminal emulator) and mbeepc85
  emulates the PC85 model (WordBee wordprocessor) [Stefano Priore]

- [JUPITER] Cartridge and Cassette Initialization fixed 
  (Bug #126) [Ben Bruscella]

- [NASCOM]  Cassette Initialization fixed
  (Bug #183) [Ben Bruscella]

  displayed (see the "Input" menu) [Stefano Priore]

- [SPECTRUM] 48k machines are now able to run code in screen memory (Bug #46).
  Fixed problem with interrupt vector set to 0xffff (much more 128k games works
  now). Corrected frames per second value for 48k and 128k Sincalir machines.
  Remaped some Spectrum+ keys. Added support to load .SP snapshots. Added .BLK
  tape images support. #FF port emulation added (Arkanoid works now but is still
  not playable due to wrong timings) (Bug #47). [Krzysztof Strzecha]

- [SPECPL3E] Updated BIOS to the 1.10 version and added support for the spanish
  romset (http://www.z88forever.org.uk/zxplus3e/) [Stefano Priore]

- [TI99/4A] xtensive rewrite: The code should be more flexible and more readable.
  * Updated tms9901 code.
  * Optional floppy controller, speech synthesizer, memory extension can be
    disabled.
  * Support for super AMS, foundation, and a myarc look-alike memory extension
    cards.
  * Improved fdc emulation.
  * Better GROM and speech timings.
  * Support for multiple extension cards, and multiple GROM ports.
  * Speech synthesizer now works!!!
  * Added support for EVPC video card. [Raphael Nabet]

- [AMSTRAD CPC] Fixed RAM configuration selection, now the original Heroquest 
  will run [Kev Thacker, Richard Wilson]

- [COCO] Converted CoCo drivers to use configurable RAM sizes, and the CoCo 3
  driver now supports the 2 MB upgrade (if I knew the specs, it would be very
  trivial for me to support the 8 MB upgrade). [Nate Woods]
  
- [COCO] Fixed a bug in DMK disk image on little endian machines. (Bug #179)
  [Nate Woods]

- [PC] Fixed a bug that caused the keyboard buffer to get flooded and the
  emulated system to get paralyzed in beeping under certain situations (bug
  #151). [Nate Woods]

- [EXIDY & KC85/3] These drivers now startup with the MAME 0.56 core. [Kev Thacker]

- [EINSTEIN] Implemented more interrupts and fixed their priorities [Kev Thacker]

- [SORD M5] Cassette writing is working, but loading is not :( [Kev Thacker]

- [TS1000] The main rom file is now called zx81a.rom, instead of zx81.rom in
  order to match the other drivers in the family. [Nate Woods]

- [COCO3] Added support for Jeff Vavassour's virtual hard disk. His Color
  Computer 3 emulator comes with an OS-9 driver. [tim lindner]

- [INTV] Added collision detection (Bug #163) [Kyle Davis]

- [PDP1] Added support for perforated tape and read-in mode.  Removed the
  current image load hack, since the use of the perforated tape reader in
  read-in mode enables the user to enter programs in an historically-correct
  way.  Various additional bug-fixes and some code clean-up.
  Added control panel, variuos memory sizes, automatic multiply/divide,
  interactive typewriter display and Spacewar! supports hyperspace controls
  now. IO code has been rewrote and timings are greatly improved.
  Teletyper output can be logged to a file (via -printer switch).
  Added support for sequence break system.
  Simulation of CRT remanence. WARNING: .rim files must be run pressing
  LCTRL+ENTER to switch into read-in mode! [Raphael Nabet]

- [APPLE1] Snapshot support added - memory dumps loaded via the image MESS 
  loading interface.  The images need a header, using the following 
  format - "LOAD:xxyyDATA:".  This header enables the emulation to load the 
  data to the correct location.  [Ben Bruscella, Stefano Priore]

- [NES] Now uses battery_save() and battery_load() to save and load battery
  backed NVRAM. [Nate Woods]

- [GENESIS] Fixed broken input in some games(Bug #139). [Anthony Kruize]

- [VECTREX] Improved detection of 3D games. [Cowering]

- [sysinfo.dat] Updates to genesis and nes [Hobie Troxell]

Source Changes:
---------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.56.  This incorporates all features of the 
  update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- The core now supports configurable RAM sizes; drivers can expose RAM
  configurations (e.g. 4k, 16k, 32k etc) and on Windows, this setting is
  exposed through a command line switch -ramsize.  [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug that prevented introducing completely new software images when
  there was already one of that particular image type already loaded. [Nate
  Woods]

- Added some infrastructure for automated tests. [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug in tape handling that would cause rewind and fast forward to not
  work if the system was stopping the tape (bug #168). [Nate Woods]

- Added battery_save() and battery_load() functions to abstract handling of
  battery-backed NVRAM on cartridges. [Nate Woods]
  
- Modified osd_fopen() with OSD_FILETYPE_NVRAM so that the filename parameter
  can specify subdirectories (for use by battery_save() and battery_load().
  [Anthony Kruize, Nate Woods]

- [Windows] Fixed a bug in the core that caused the MESS process to not die if
  the close box was pressed, and the UI was disabled (bug #170). [Nate Woods]
 
- [Windows] Fixed a bug in the GUI that caused heap corruptions. [Nate Woods]

- [Windows] Fixed a bug in the GUI that caused auditing to report BIOS-less
  console systems as missing BIOSes. [Nate Woods]

- [IMGTOOL/Windows] Added wildcard support in the put command, since the
  Windows shell doesn't do this by default. [Nate Woods] 
  
- [IMGTOOL/FAT driver] Fixed bug where files would get stored into a FAT image
  without forcing the filename to upper case. [Nate Woods]

- [MacMESS] Added configurable RAM sizes and dipswitch controls to the MESS
  tab. [tim lindner]

- sfzch, snes
