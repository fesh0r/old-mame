 and hooked the rtc clock, command and strobe lines up in a plausible
 configuration. The status line clock now works though shows an invalid
 value for year (the upd1990a didn't have a year response, so perhaps
 whatever rtc is being used here is a later variant which does store a
 year). The "date set" command doesn't work properly and doesn't even
 seem to poke the rtc at all. Needs further investigation.

 default hardware configuration setting of ~180 degrees
 [i.e. $17 = 179.92706396 & $18 = 179.927063726]. [Robert Tuccitto]

Source Changes
--------------
-floppy: Random fixes/logging [O. Galibert]

-upd765: Modernize [O. Galibert]

 Remaining TODO list:
 * take WP into account
 * test the amstrad, implement its observational format (edsk) using
    pasti as a start.  Or find the legendary amstrad IPFs.  Or both.
 * correct read track, the implementation is completely wrong.  See
    previous for testing, it's only used in protections the check the
    inter-sector gaps.
 * shake and bake on the amstrad, protections are the best to find
    bugs in a fdc
 * add the scan id commands, but nothing seems to use them
 * debug the 2.88M formatting which is unreliable.  Fix its IDAM/DAM
    gap size on formatting too (but that's not what's making it
    unreliable)
 * test all the systems that were hit, and fix what needs to be fixed.
    Beware that multiple problems may happen:
 * upd765 may be wrong
 * the driver may not be working
 * the hookup may be wrong/incomplete (bitrate selection and floppy
    rpm in particular)
 * the driver may be too limited for the new implementation (the x68k
    dma device does not handle non-instant dma yet for instance)
 * report invalid command when appropriate depending on the actual
    chip emulated
 * add the russian clones with their real names

-d88: Reduce the gap3 size from the standard value when the data
 otherwise won't fit [O. Galibert]

-upd765: Implement LOCK [O. Galibert]
