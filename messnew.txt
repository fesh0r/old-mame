0.72

New System Drivers Supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------------
(none)

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- [COCO3] Fixed a bug whereby $FE00-$FEFF would be mapped to the wrong memory
  when bit 3 of $FF90 was set when more than 512k was available.  This caused
  some NitrOS-9 programs to crash when allocating too much memory (bug #352).
  [Nate Woods]

- [COCO3] Added '_' to the supported keys for the natural keyboard.  '_' is
  specific to [Nitr]OS-9. [Nate Woods]

- [JAGUAR] Some enhancements to the blitter; most games are still not
  playable however. [Nate Woods]

- [NES] Updated NES so that it uses the ppu2c03b support within MAME (which
  was actually originally based on the MESS NES driver code). [Brad Oliver,
  Nate Woods]
  
- [PC] Made fonts, monitor types and CGA chipsets configurable. [John Elliot] 

- [PC] Basic state save support. [Nate Woods]

- [SNES] Name select is only for sprites using tiles over 255. Fixed sprite
  wrap at the bottom of the screen. Fixed clearing of HDMA channels. Fixed
  background colours in mode 0. [Jimmy Li, Anthony Kruize]

- [TI99] Several behind-the-scenes changes to support TI-99/8 emulation
  (which is not 100% working and disabled in MESS builds but implemented
  in source code).  Hopefully, there will be no change in functionality in
  the various TI-99/4(a) drivers. [Raphael Nabet]
  
- [VECTREX] Fixed a bug that prevented the default mine.art file from being
  loaded if no other artwork was found. [Nate Woods]

User Interface Changes:
-----------------------
- Added separate configuration menu, to be used for configuration items that
  were formerly represented with DIP switches.  [Nate Woods]
  
- [Windows] Revamped options menu, and added a keyboard customization menu.
  Also added the ability to create artwork for controller configuration
  screens (used NES as a testbed).  [Nate Woods]

Imgtool Changes:
----------------
- [MAC] Added preliminary support for MFS images. [Raphael Nabet]
- [TI99] Added support for HD images. [Raphael Nabet]

Source Changes:
---------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.72.  This incorporates all features of the
  update to this core.  [MAME team]

- Fixed a bug that would cause a hang when parsing certain invalid filenames
  (for example, D:\FOO\D:\FOO\BAR.ZIP). [Nate Woods]

- Revamped some inputs, added IPT_MOUSE, IPT_START, and IPT_SELECT.  The
  latter two can be used with IPF_PLAYER masks.  Also removed legacy
  IPT_SELECT1-4, and IPT_START1-4 should no longer be used by MESS. 
  [Nate Woods]

- Tripled the delay in which wd179x errors are reported.  This manifested
  itself in the CoCo driver by an emulated crash on some versions of NitrOS-9
  when run on a write protected image. [Nate Woods]
