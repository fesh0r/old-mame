 [Team Europe]

Source Changes
--------------
-cat.c (Canon Cat): Fixed the v2.40 bioses thinking the phone is
 constantly ringing; Documented what all the DUART IO pins are
 connected to, and correctly hooked DUART IP2 up to invert when the 6ms
 timer expires, removing the previous hack (and fixing the ringing
 bug). [Lord Nightmare]

-c64: Fixed MACH 5 cartridge C128 mode. [Curt Coder]

-c64: Added support for the standard MIDI cartridges:
 Passport/Syntech, Siel/JMS/DATEL, Sequential, Namesoft, and Maplin.
 [Curt Coder]

-Apple II: Allow Super Serial Card to connect to MESS's serial
 terminal and null modem devices. [R. Belmont]

 software mode.  Enough to get the CD-ROM working under Win95.
 [Barry Rodewald]

-Added hook-up for CD Block command 0x64 (Put Sector Data) [Angelo Salese]

-megadriv.c: emulated protection in mulan, pokemon 2 (previously patched 
 out) and in the real ttoon3 dump. [Fabio Priuli]

-ColecoVision: controller has a * key, not a . key [Nick3092]

-Apple II: Added support for Street Electronics Echo Plus and
 Zip Technologies ZipDrive cards [R. Belmont, Lord Nightmare]

-dectalk.c: renamed dectalk roms to match the DEC 23-xxxLn standard and
 noted what their actual paper labels were (these paper labels will
 differ on different dectalk units depending on exactly when they were
 made, though the ROM contents are exactly the same! The derivable
 23-xxxLn part number will not change, though.). Added more comments.
 [Lord Nightmare]

-supercon: Fix regressions [Ralf Schäfer]

-odyssey2.c: Further palette improvements.  [Dr. Venom]

-cbm8096: Emulated the 64KB memory expansion card, and promoted
 driver to working. [Curt Coder]

-cat.c: (Canon Cat) Fixed a mistake in the memory map mirroring due to
 an error during testing; added proper readback of the floppy control
 register, and corrected the floppy status readback so it thinks that
 no floppy is inserted. [Lord Nightmare]

-gameboy.c: fixed cart type for MBC1 collection games, promoting
 Bomberman Collection, Genjin Collection, Momotarou Collection, Mortal
 Kombat I & II and Super Chinese Land 1.2.3 to working state
 [Fabio Priuli]

-gbcolor.c: added support for Sintax mapper, promoting a dozen of
 pirate games to working state [taizou, Fabio Priuli]

-PlayStation: Fix CD-ROM regression [R. Belmont]

-isa_ide: correctly mapped alternate port [Miodrag Milanovic]

-megadriv.c: emulated protection in pirate Super Mario World 64,
 based on research by Eke and andlabs [Fabio Priuli]

 Ling/Pokemon Pikecho. [Fabio Priuli]

 Card. [R. Belmont]

 PAL (a7800p) palettes
 * Palette rebuild due to misaligned data references
 * Corrected PAL color sequence order

 [Fabio Priuli]

-gameboy: added correct handling of Echo RAM, needed by Rockman 8. 
 [Fabio Priuli]

-profweis: added another bios version. [Team Europe]

-snes.c: several updates to cart handling [Fabio Priuli]
 * moved Sufami Turbo and BSX carts to separate lists
 * added emulation for DSP1/4, ST-010/011, S-DD1, SPC7110, SuperFX,
    BS-X and Sufami Turbo as slot devices
 * added emulation for the protection device used in some pirate carts
   
-Fix AES cart swap sound crash. [R. Belmont]

-vk100.c (DEC GIGI/VK100): Hooked up the direction prom to the
 vector generator rather than using a hack. Still a lot of work to go,
 but the test mode looks like it at least starts off running more
 correctly before it fails. [Lord Nightmare]

-Modernized vc4000 device.  [Andrew Gardner]

-snes.c: updated the driver to only save the real amount of SRAM
 present on the cart. This means that old .nv files won't be directly
 compatible with newer exe, but you shall be able to keep your saves by
 backing them up and taking the first block of the correct size (e.g.
 if you take the first 8KB block of your old .nv for Super Metroid it
 should work fine with the new exe). At the same time, MESS should be
 now compatible with saves taken in other emulators. [Fabio Priuli]

-cat.c (Canon Cat): Got rid of the keyboard interrupt timer and
 hooked the keyboard interrupt to the 6ms timer instead, which is
 closer to hardware. The cursor blinks at a more correct but not
 completely correct rate now. The duart (the REAL source of the
 interrupts, which should fire with the transitions of the 12ms period
 squarewave) still does not work for interrupts properly, it needs its
 innards fixed. [Lord Nightmare]

-Modernized wswan, special, and svision devices. [Andrew Gardner]

-sms.c:  [Enik Land]
 * Fixed master clock speed for PAL machines.
 * Improved hcount handling resulting in better results from Flubba's
    VDP timing checks.

-snes.c: misc work on pirate carts.  [Fabio Priuli]
 * added support for Korean Super 20 Collection multigame cart, even
    if a few games still have glitches.
 * added support for bankswitch mechanism used in a few pirate
    multigame carts.
 * added support for protection used by Tekken 2 and Street Fighter
    Alpha EX, based on notes by d4s and nocash.

-3c505: fix typo that broke TCP [Hans Ostermeyer]

-snes.c: major overhaul of cart and add-on handling [Fabio Priuli]
 * updated carts to be slot devices
 * simplified loading and bankswitch mechanism
 * removed drivers snessfx and snespsfx: SuperFX/GSU games can now be
    loaded in snes and snespal
 * removed drivers snesdsp and snespdsp: NEC DSPx games can now be
    loaded in snes and snespal from softlist
 * removed drivers snesst10 and snesst11: Seta DSP games can now be
    loaded in snes and snespal from softlist
 * removed driver snesst: when you load Sufami Turbo, two more cart
    slots (-cart2 and -cart3) become available to load ST carts
 * added preliminary support for games with BS-X slots: when you load
    one of these, a -cart2 slot becomes available to load a 8MB memory
    pack (only a few of these work at the moment, e.g. Same Game)
 * added support for loading DSPx games with DSP dump appended at the
    end of the .sfc file

-snes.c: added support in snes and snespal for loading from
 fullpath DSPx and ST01x games missing the DSP data, i.e. the commonly
 available dumps, without using clone systems (softlists had no
 problems with these games because the DSP data come from the softlist
 romset) [Fabio Priuli]

-megadriv.c: emulated reset-based Codemaster 2-in-1 carts (2psymmac). 
 [Fabio Priuli]
