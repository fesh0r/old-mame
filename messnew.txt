 5 pirate.  [Wilbert Pol]

-samcoupe.c: modified the driver to not install / uninstall bank
 handlers, greatly improving performaces (e.g. Manic Miner demo went

[Wilbert Pol]

-mac: Support original Macintosh II Video Card
 [R. Belmont, Sharkpuncher]

-hp9k: made drive go into boot process [Gabriele D'Antona]

-craft: added basic Timer 1 support to Craft driver and hooked up the DAC,
 currently plays only a buzzing noise due to lacking EEPROM support
 [MooglyGuy]

 [R. Belmont, Sharkpuncher]

-mac: Add support for PDS Sigma Designs L-View card
 [R. Belmont, Sharkpuncher]

-a2600: Reimplemented the a2600 controllers as vcs controller
 devices. Switched the a2600 drivers to use slot devices for choosing
 controllers.  [Wilbert Pol]

-craft.c: Fixed DAC bit order, audio now plays but is 40% too slow
 [Mooglyguy]

-craft.c: Preliminary video support, bad vsync and colors still.
 [MooglyGuy]

-mac: Preliminary support for Micron XCEED 30HR and MacroColor
 30 PDS cards [R. Belmont, Sharkpuncher, Balrog]

-a7800: NTSC Color Generator utilized for color palette with 
 hue shift/start based on observation of several systems across 
 multiple displays [Robert Tuccitto]
 
Software Lists:
----------------
-32x: added region compatibility filters to the software list
 [Fabio Priuli, Tafoid, Bobz]

-spectrum_cass.xml: added very preliminary softlist containing
 some interesting test case for emulation. [David Haywood]

-pcw16.xml: added softlist for available disk images [remax]

-snes.xml: added region compatibility filters to the software list
 [Fabio Priuli, Tafoid, Bobz]

-amiga.xml: added placeholder lists for system disks. [David Haywood]

-amiga: added very preliminary softlist for game disks
 [David Haywood]

-ibm5150.xml: updated with recent dumps. [Kaylee]

Source Changes
--------------
-floppy: Random fixes/logging [O. Galibert]

-upd765: Modernize [O. Galibert]

 Remaining TODO list:
 * take WP into account
 * test the amstrad, implement its observational format (edsk) using
    pasti as a start.  Or find the legendary amstrad IPFs.  Or both.
 * correct read track, the implementation is completely wrong.  See
    previous for testing, it's only used in protections the check the
    inter-sector gaps.
 * shake and bake on the amstrad, protections are the best to find
    bugs in a fdc
 * add the scan id commands, but nothing seems to use them
 * debug the 2.88M formatting which is unreliable.  Fix its IDAM/DAM
    gap size on formatting too (but that's not what's making it
    unreliable)
 * test all the systems that were hit, and fix what needs to be fixed.
    Beware that multiple problems may happen:
 * upd765 may be wrong
 * the driver may not be working
 * the hookup may be wrong/incomplete (bitrate selection and floppy
    rpm in particular)
 * the driver may be too limited for the new implementation (the x68k
    dma device does not handle non-instant dma yet for instance)
 * report invalid command when appropriate depending on the actual
    chip emulated
 * add the russian clones with their real names

-d88: Reduce the gap3 size from the standard value when the data
 otherwise won't fit [O. Galibert]

-upd765: Implement LOCK [O. Galibert]

-upd765: Fix busy status when seeking [O. Galibert]

-upd765: Fix MSR DIO in EXEC phase [O. Galibert]

-add innovation ssi-2001 sid-on-isa device [Carl]

-upd765: Fix the dump regs command, don't exit on unknown
 commands and add dsr reset [O. Galibert]

-added basic support for the loop flags in tzx [David Haywood]
