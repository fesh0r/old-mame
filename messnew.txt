0.61

New System Drivers Supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------------
- Super GameBoy [Anthony Kruize]
- GameBoy Color (preliminary) [Anthony Kruize]
- Innumerable Sega Master System Variants [Mike Luong]

Removed drivers:
----------------------
- Amstrad
- Chess Champion I
- Sinclair ZX Family
- Studio 2

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- [COCO] The virtual printer should now be responsive to bitbanger output of
  any arbitrary baud. [Nate Woods]

- [COCO] Fixed a OKI M6242B clock emulation problem and a problem with Disto
  Real Time Clock emulation. [tim lindner]

- [COCO] Fixed a very ugly bug that could cause freezups under OS-9 and other
  forms of disk accesses.  This was because interrupts were dropped when the
  CPU is halted. (Bugs #197, #229) [Nate Woods]

- [COCO3] Fixed a bug in the GIME video emulation that caused all parts of
  the $FF9B/D/E video registers to be used in lo-res mode; where in reality
  the low 16 bits are dropped.  This caused a bug in CoCoTracker that caused
  the screen to be garbled after the MOD files are played. [Nate Woods]

- [COCO3] Adjusted composite colors slightly with help from SockMaster (Bug
  #227) [John Kowalski, Nate Woods]
  
- [COCO3] Exposed the two high bits on MMU registers (even though their value
  is undefined) to fix a problem with SockMaster's LSAVEM utility. [Nate Woods]
  
- [COLECO] The Coleco driver now recognizes the *.col extension for Coleco
  cartridges. [Nate Woods]
  
- [SPECPL3E] Updated BIOS to the 1.11 version romset
  (http://www.z88forever.org.uk/zxplus3e/) [Stefano Priore]

- [GAMEBOY] Can now load ROMs that are larger than 2MB. Fixed RAM bank
  switching in MBC3 ROMs. [Anthony Kruize]

- [COUPE] Combined coupe and coupe512 drivers into one driver that uses
  configurable RAM sizes. [Nate Woods]
  
- [A2600] Converted video code from using plot_pixel() to draw_scanline() [Nate
  Woods]
  
- [VTECH1] Converted back to using generic M6847 video hardware module (Bug #36)
  [Nate Woods]

- [SNES] Rewrite of the driver.  Still at a preliminary stage though. Some
  games are playable, others run but aren't playable, however most don't work.
  [Anthony Kruize]
  
- [VECTREX] Because of the MAME core's new artwork system, new .art files are
  now needed in conjunction with the normal Vectrex .png files to specify the
  artwork layout. [Nate Woods]

- [GENESIS] Changed input ports to be consistent with other drivers.
  [Anthony Kruize]

Source Changes:
---------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.61.  This incorporates all features of the 
  update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- Converted numerous drivers to use the auto_malloc() and auto_bitmap_alloc()
  calls, and also to use generic_bitmapped video calls. [Nate Woods]

- Added new videomap code that makes it easy to support arbitrary video modes
  in a fast, efficient manner.  This takes the place of the old
  rasterbits/rastertrack code; converted m6847, CoCo 3, and Mac video hardware
  to use videomap. [Nate Woods]

- Added a new disk format handling system that allows disk formats to be
  generically specified in such a way usable by both MESS itself, and imgtool
  [Nate Woods]

- Fixed a bug in the wave code that could cause a crash if a cassette image is
  unloaded. [Nate Woods]
  
- Added a [none] entry in the File Manager, that allows the user to unload an
  image. [Nate Woods]
  
- The file manager will now default to the directory that a preexisting image
  resides in. [Nate Woods]

- Fixed some bugs that caused the battery backups in the NES and GB systems to
  be placed in odd directories. [Nate Woods]
  
- Added palette_set_colors() function to make it easy to initialize a palette
  with a predefined list of colors. [Nate Woods]
  
- Readded record/playback support. [Nate Woods]

- Added artwork_use_device_art() to the MAME core to support Vectrex style
  artwork. [Nate Woods]

- Fixed bugs #192 and #200 - remember that:

  1) In File Manager you can press SHIFT+ENTER to manually edit a filename
     and CTRL-Y to delete the field.

  2) In the file selector you can edit the file specification and you can use
     SHIFT+UP/DOWN as PgUp/PgDown and
     CTRL+UP/DOWN as Home/End. [Stefano Priore]

- With help from SockMaster, fixed some very subtle timer bugs in the m6809
  and hd6309 CPU cores [Nate Woods, tim lindner, John Kowalski]
  
- New OSD function:

		void osd_device_eject(int type, int id);

  It sets a device image to NULL, as would a device_filename_change(type, id,
  NULL), but enables osd code to update its osd structures.  The mac and lisa
  drivers will use this function instead of device_filename_change to eject
  floppy disks.

  This function is needed because the mac osd code keeps track of each
  selected file, and the data went out of sync when device_filename_change
  was called. [Raphael Nabet]

- [GUI] Fixed a very minor bug that caused the software list view background
  to not be updated at the same time as the system list if the snap directory
  was changed. [Nate Woods]
