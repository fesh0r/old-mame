System Driver Changes:
---------------------- 
- [A2600] Complete driver rewrite, including emulation of the 6532 RIOT (RAM, 
  INPUT, OUTPUT, TIMER) chip, cycle count correction in the t6502 core (fixes 
  games like Space Invaders) and a new tia core.  [Stefan Jokisch]

- [APPLE2] Enhanced models now have the M65C02 processor specified; apple2c
  now boots.  Removed *.vid files from the BIOS set in favor of the proper
  character ROMs (suffixed with *.chr).  80-character text mode fixed (bug
  #311).  Implemented double hires mode (bug #303) and support for the
  alternate character set.  [Nate Woods]

- [APPLE2] Now uses the Robert Munafo palette. [Steve Nickolas]

- [AQUARIUS] The palette now corresponds to the one described in the User's
  Manual. [Stefano Priore]

- [COCO] PIA properly resets. [Nate Woods]

- [PC] Fixed bugs in CGA and MDA rendering (bugs #339 and #374).  Also speeded
  up EGA/VGA rendering and marked 'xtvga' as working. [Nate Woods]

- [SNES] Improved 16x16 background tile mode. Fixed another GDMA bug. Various
  mode 7 fixes. Fixed background priorities in modes 2 to 7. Added support for
  direct select to mode 7. Removed support for horizontal interrupts as it was
  totally broken. 16bit by 8bit multiply is now signed. [Anthony Kruize]

- [SUPERGB/GBCOLOR] No longer marked as clones of the GameBoy. [Anthony
  Kruize]

- [TI99] Added support for Thierry Nouspickel's IDE card prototype. Added
  incomplete but working support for the HFDC disk controller card and 80-
  track drives. Added support for a fourth floppy drive with non-TI floppy
  controllers. Fixed Super AMS memory card emulation. [Raphael Nabet]


Source Changes:
---------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.68.  This incorporates all features of the
  update to this core.  [MAME team]

- Drivers now have a 'compatible_with' field, that specify drivers that have
  compatible software but are not mere clones.  [Nate Woods]

- Devices are now referenced by a mess_image pointer, rather than a type/id
  pair. [Nate Woods]
  
- Enhanced MESS's natural keyboard facility, so that drivers can specify
  handlers to bypass keypress simulation.  [Nate Woods]

- Changed device load and unload so that all devices are loaded before machine
  init, but not necessarily driver init, in response to a bug (bug #366).
  [Nate Woods]

- [Windows] Default directories for the file dialogs can now be specified on
  a device type basis at the command line (e.g. -floppydisk_dir).  This
  option will get written out when launched from the GUI, so that per system
  directories can be recorded (bug #345). [Nate Woods]

- [Windows GUI] Fixed a bug whereby extra software paths with spaces in them
  would not be properly persisted (bug #369). [Nate Woods]

- [Imgtool] Enabled support for ti99 disk formats with more than 1600 sectors.
  Added support for v9t9 and pc99 disk image formats (note that these image
  formats are supported by imgtool, but not by the ti99 driver).
